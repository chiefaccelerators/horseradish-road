## Summary

*When I get off the wheel I’m going to stop
And make amends to everyone I’ve wounded
And when I wave my magic wand
Those few who’ve slipped the surly bonds
Will rise like salmon at the spawning*

If you read this before the rest of *A Wheel Inside a Wheel*, do so at your own risk of major spoilers.
