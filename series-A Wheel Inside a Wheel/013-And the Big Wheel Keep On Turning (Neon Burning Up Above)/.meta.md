## Summary

"Deleted" scenes from *A Wheel Inside a Wheel*. Chapters will be arranged in chronological, rather than posting, order. Check the beginning notes for the index. All chapters are standalone, so this fic is "complete", but it will be added to when I feel like it.

## Notes

Chapter 1 \- Yang/Reuenthal/Mittermeyer. Takes place immediately after *Serpent's Mouth, Serpent's Teeth* ch 8.
Chapter 2 \- Magdalena/Yang. Takes place immediately after *Serpent's Mouth, Serpent's Teeth* ch 16.
Chapter 3 \- Martin/Kircheis. Takes place immediately after *Serpent's Mouth, Serpent's Teeth* ch 33.
