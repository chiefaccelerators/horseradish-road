<p>
<span>As Yang left to go to the bathroom, Reuenthal sat back down next to Mittermeyer. He stretched out his arms across the back of the couch, pretending to be relaxed, but Mittermeyer could see right through him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you scared him,” Mittermeyer said when Yang was out of sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh?” Reuenthal asked. “You think he’s running away because I told him the truth?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you’re pushing things too far.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think so, Wolf? Did I scare you, too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There wasn’t any way that Mittermeyer could answer that question. The image of Reuenthal placing the palm crown on Yang’s head was etched in his vision. It was powerful, but too intimate. It wasn’t something he should have gotten to see, though he was glad that he had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His silence made Reuenthal touch his hair, brush his fingers over the cool gloss of sweat on his forehead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Should I have put it on your head, instead?” Reuenthal asked, as if he had been reading Mittermeyer’s mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That wasn’t a question that would get an answer either, but Reuenthal didn’t really want an answer. What he wanted was for Mittermeyer to kiss him, which Mittermeyer could certainly do. He turned to place his hand on Reuenthal’s chest, and pushed him back against the arm of the couch. Reuenthal leaned back with the dignity of pretending like he was going of his own accord, and swung one of his legs up onto the couch so that Mittermeyer was between his knees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long is he going to stay in the bathroom?” Mittermeyer asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’ll be back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was fine, he supposed, so he leaned down towards Reuenthal, who tried to kiss him hungrily, though Mittermeyer nipped at his lips before he let him really begin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their position on the couch was not the most comfortable, with Mittermeyer propped up on one arm, almost squeezing Reuenthal off the furniture, but it was the kind of momentary discomfort that made Mittermeyer feel aware of himself, made his motions extra deliberate as he wrapped his legs around Reuenthal’s and began fingering open the buttons of his shirt with his free hand. He got it open enough that he could slide his hand down from Reuenthal’s collarbone to his stomach, feeling the taughtness of his muscles underneath his skin. He was cold, but since Mittermeyer was overly warm, this was perfect. He pulled the shirt out of its once-neat tuck and Reuenthal shrugged it off gracefully, only taking his hands off Mittermeyer’s back and hips to pull his arms out of the sleeves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer pressed himself onto Reuenthal more heavily, grinding their hips together. He didn’t know why he was taking things so far so quickly— Yang would be back in a minute and they would probably stop— but this was just what being with Reuenthal did to him. It made him lose boundaries that he should have maintained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal’s breathing was heavy and erratic, and he tossed his head to the side, baring his throat, letting Mittermeyer bite at the tender flesh just above his collarbone. It would all be covered by his uniform, so it was alright to leave a mark. Mittermeyer closed his eyes, savored the sensation of Reuenthal twitching beneath him as his teeth and tongue and breath played across his throat. Mittermeyer could feel his pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are you going?” Reuenthal asked, his throat buzzing under Mittermeyer’s lips. His voice was unexpectedly lucid— more than Mittermeyer would have been capable of, and the frankness of it shocked Mittermeyer out of the moment, making him sit up. Reuenthal straighted too, propping himself up on his elbows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang, startled, was headed for the door. Mittermeyer hadn’t even heard him come in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should go—” Yang said. He was staring at Reuenthal with the same expression he had worn all night— or some variation of it. Seeking, but not desperate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Reuenthal said. “Stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang’s lips parted in silent surprise, and in the frozen moment as they both processed what Reuenthal had said, Mittermeyer realized that Yang was not looking at Reuenthal, but was looking at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps Reuenthal was pushing things too far, just as he always did. If Mittermeyer so much as blinked, he knew that Yang would give a little, quivering smile, shake his head gently, and turn again for the door, and they would never speak of this again. That was the kind of person that he was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t that he was afraid— that wasn’t it. From the way he locked eyes with Mittermeyer across the room, it was obvious that he wanted to stay, but hadn’t given himself permission to imagine that he might.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the same thing they had spoken about during the evening. Yang hadn’t wanted to ask Mittermeyer to join him, didn’t want to be the one to create that pressure. Yang could satisfy himself with something less.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Mittermeyer had pledged to follow him. Perhaps Reuenthal was right to push him now: these things must be one and the same.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although his train of thought felt muddled and sluggish, it only took him a moment to come to a decision. He couldn’t have put it into words, so he just held out his hand towards Yang.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer wondered if he would regret it later, as he regretted so many things. But he thought that the look of utter relief on Yang’s face might innoculate him against regret. It was sweet, the way he broke into a gentle smile and took a few still-hesitant steps forward. This was for reasons of practical confusion more than anything else: the couch was not big enough for three.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer realized this and hastily disentangled himself from Reuenthal so that he could stand. He also wondered where he should go, but then Yang was right in front of him, and so it no longer mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come here, Wen-li,” Mittermeyer said, and was surprised at how warm his own voice was. Yang took the last couple steps, and it was never more obvious that he should put his hands on Yang’s hips and pull him forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was funny— Mittermeyer had never thought much about how close in height he and Yang were. He didn’t need to pull Yang down to kiss him— he was just there. Yang figured out what he wanted to do with his hands, reaching for Mittermeyer’s face and brushing the pad of his thumb along his cheek, catching a little on the two days of stubble there. Their eyes met for just a moment, and then Yang tangled his hand in Mittermeyer’s hair, and leaned in the rest of the way to kiss him, still smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang was very accommodating when he kissed, unlike Reuenthal in every way, letting Mittermeyer set the pace without any rush or urgency of his own. Yang kept forgetting and then remembering where his hands were and what he was supposed to be doing with them, so Mittermeyer was treated to stops and starts of him combing his fingers through his hair, or tracing his hand along his back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Yang pulled away for a moment to breathe and to push some of his shaggy hair out of his face, Mittermeyer realized that Reuenthal was still laying on the couch and silently watching them. He turned to look at him, and rolled his eyes at Reuenthal’s smug expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you just going to sit there?” Mittermeyer asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m enjoying myself. And I’m patient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you’re not,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh?” His smirk was unabated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Saying anything else to Reuenthal would only cause him to double down, so Mittermeyer turned back to Yang. “Suit yourself,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer found that when kissing Yang it was easier to undo his belt than anything else, so he did that, which gave him leeway to pull Yang even closer so that he could slip his hands down the back of his pants. Yang laughed and tried to reciprocate, but now he was too close to undo Mittermeyer’s belt, so he could only vainly slide his hands along Mittermeyer’s jacket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal finally stood and came up behind Yang, who didn’t notice him moving. He jumped when he felt Reuenthal’s hands on his waist, but he smiled without turning around. “Took you long enough,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer met Reuenthal’s eyes, and Reuenthal continued to wear his smuggest expression. Mittermeyer couldn’t help but smile back. “Do something useful, then,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.” Reuenthal’s voice dipped low, and Yang shivered as he slid his cold hands up underneath his shirt. Reuenthal had to pull Yang’s jacket off first, and Yang complied when Reuenthal tugged it off over his head. Mittermeyer got to work on the buttons of Yang’s shirtsleeves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Yang made some halfhearted attempts to reach behind himself to make Reuenthal come kiss him, his smile and the pliant way he moved when both of them took turns removing his clothes made it clear that he was enjoying it. He had an unselfconsciousness that Mittermeyer envied, as he discarded Yang’s shirt and trailed his hand down Yang’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal pulled down Yang’s pants and underwear, and Yang had to step out of them to avoid tripping. It was incredible how quickly someone could be undressed when two people made it their goal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang was happy to let Mittermeyer and Reuenthal move in unison to kiss or bite his neck, but when Reuenthal tried to reach around him for his dick, Yang stopped him. “I thought you said you were patient,” he said, lightly grabbing Reuenthal’s wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I lied.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang laughed, maybe from what Reuenthal was saying, maybe from the way Mittermeyer’s hair was tickling his neck. “You have me at a disadvantage. Two on one isn’t really fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you liked being at a disadvantage,” Reuenthal teased. “You once said it gives you opportunities to be creative.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He tried to reach around Yang with his other hand, but Yang unexpectedly squirmed out of the way in the only direction he could move, encircled by the two of them as he was. He dropped down into a crouch. Even if he had only intended to wiggle out of their grasp, Mittermeyer stepped back to give him room, and it was enough space to make him change his mind and land on his knees instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, Yang could easily reach to undo Mittermeyer’s belt, which he did. He stopped and looked up at Mittermeyer before he did anything else, hesitating again now that it was his turn to take initiative. His eyes were invitingly open— had Mittermeyer never noticed how nice they were before? Or maybe he just hadn’t let himself notice the way Yang’s eyes were easy to be captured by, like the gravity well of black holes. In response to Yang’s silent question, he touched his cheek, and stroked his hair back from his forehead, though it immediately fell back down into place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang smiled at him, just for a moment, then focused on pulling Mittermeyer’s pants down. Reuenthal left his position behind Yang and came up beside Mittermeyer, though he almost didn’t notice. He had his eyes closed, and he was too focused on the feeling of Yang’s touch: first on his calves, then his thighs, and then on his dick as Yang took it in hand. He was still only half hard, but it was already overwhelming, and only became moreso when Reuenthal turned Mittermeyer’s head so that he could kiss him— finally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang nuzzled the soft flesh of Mittermeyer’s inner thighs for just a moment before licking the head of his dick and slipping it in his mouth. Mittermeyer made a noise of pleasure, one that came from deep in his chest, and he had to restrain himself from thrusting his hips forward and pushing his cock all the way to Yang’s throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Reuenthal said, in response to Mittermeyer’s moan, and Mittermeyer cracked his eyes open to see that Reuenthal had his hand tangled in Yang’s hair. Mittermeyer wanted to admire the sight, but Reuenthal was kissing him again, so he couldn’t see a thing. He closed his eyes once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His attention was split between Reuenthal’s greedy tongue slipping across his teeth, and Yang slowly taking more of him into his mouth. The sensations seemed to meld into each other, taking up his whole perception and leaving him completely defenseless. Yang was right: two on one was unfair. He could feel his self control slipping— when Reuenthal sucked on his lip, Mittermeyer’s hips jerked and he thrust into Yang’s mouth. He tried to withdraw in apology, but Yang’s hand, which was clinging to his thigh for support, just rubbed an encouraging circle with his thumb, and he took Mittermeyer as deeply into his mouth as he could. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wen-li,” Mittermeyer mumbled as Reuenthal kissed his jaw beneath his ear. “Please.” He didn’t really even know what he was asking for, but Yang gave it. Mittermeyer was already close to coming, painfully close, and he couldn’t stop himself from seeking it out, pushing towards that conclusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Reuenthal knew that Mittermeyer was close, too. Just before it all went too far, he pulled on Yang’s hair and tugged him back away from Mittermeyer, making him release his dick with a wet pop, spit trailing across his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey—” Mittermeyer said, not quite annoyed, but unexpectedly brought out of the haze of pleasure that made it hard to think. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want my turn, too,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t like I was going to forget,” Yang said— even now, he could joke. He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand, and reached for Reuenthal’s belt, but Reuenthal stopped his hand and pulled him to his feet instead. Yang looked at him questioningly, but Reuenthal just answered the question by kissing him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer sat down on the armchair, taking a moment to come down from his previous high, and just watched the possessive way that Reuenthal kissed Yang, devoured him. Mittermeyer wondered if Reuenthal could taste any of himself in Yang’s mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer had sometimes thought about what Yang and Reuenthal looked like together— nights when the three of them were on Odin, and Mittermeyer left to go home, he would sometimes lay in bed and find himself absently picturing it. Feeling, not exactly jealousy, but something else that he couldn’t name. The reality juxtaposed over the remnants of his imagination gave the scene a dreamlike quality, like Mittermeyer was floating just outside it. The thought and sight made Mittermeyer stroke his dick— slowly. Just enough to keep him present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal pulled Yang against himself: providing pressure, if not touching Yang’s cock directly. Yang seemed lost in it all; his breathing was irregular and he clung to Reuenthal for support, shaky on his feet. Reuenthal scraped his fingers down Yang’s back, right between his shoulderblades, making his breath hitch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal broke off the kiss for just long enough to look at Mittermeyer, and an electric feeling went through him when their eyes met, one that made him take his hand off his dick. Reuenthal would be annoyed if he came, or at least would pretend to be. Reuenthal’s lip curled in a possessive, cruel smile, and he went back to kissing Yang, tugging on his hair as he did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He got the feeling that Reuenthal was teasing him, playing a game with Mittermeyer’s patience as well as his own. How long would it take for Reuenthal to let Yang turn around? Yang kept making little movements— shuffles of his feet, twitches of his head, turns of his shoulders— that made it clear that he, too, wanted to look at Mittermeyer. But Reuenthal’s hand in his hair kept him in place, and Yang hadn’t yet decided to fight it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps Yang didn’t need to turn around. Mittermeyer could get up. There was nothing stopping him. But he had disconnected himself from the scene, and he was taking in every detail and letting them pass through him, and felt unable to break past the invisible wall he found himself on the wrong side of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wolf,” Yang said, breathy from the way Reuenthal was touching him. “Where are you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>His voice, with its note of real want, freed Mittermeyer from his stasis, and made everything simple once again. It was always like this— whatever Yang said to him would feel so bright in an instant of clarity, but would be lost in the murky darkness as soon as Mittermeyer let himself be alone. He moved without really thinking about it, stood, and brushed his hand across Yang’s back. Yang hummed in contentment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He wondered if Reuenthal and Yang felt the same way as he did, when they separated. He pushed the thought out of his mind, and instead kept moving. He stepped lightly past Yang and strode towards Reuenthal’s bedroom. He knew that they would follow him, and they did. He removed his shirt as he went, tired of having it on, and dropped it on the floor somewhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t bother turning on the overhead light— it was easy enough to see by the light spilling in from the living room. On the bed, he discovered that was where Yang had left his crown of palm leaves. Mittermeyer picked it up as Reuenthal and Yang came in, and Yang gave it a somewhat skeptical glance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You forgot this,” Mittermeyer said. But when Yang opened his mouth to protest, he just tossed it to him. Yang caught the circle of palm leaves and looked at it. Stripped of the power it had possessed when Reuenthal placed it on his head, it had become just an object. Yang turned it around in his hands for a moment, and relaxed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal did not relax, standing stiffly in the doorway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you done pretending to be patient?” Mittermeyer asked him. He walked over and hooked his fingers in the waistband of the pants that Reuenthal was still somehow wearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It seems like you are,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang sprawled on the bed, flopping down contentedly like his strings had been cut, and this made it difficult for Mittermeyer to pull and shove Reuenthal down without whacking Yang accidentally. But Yang rolled out of the way and just watched with a funny smile as Mittermeyer pinned Reuenthal to the bed, hands on Reuenthal’s shoulders. Reuenthal put up some token resistance, but was happy to finally be on th bed, pinned down beneath Mittermeyer. It was what he had been aiming for all night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer looked over at Yang. “Are you going to do something useful?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Yang said. “Absolutely not.” But despite saying this, he reached over and brushed the hair off of Reuenthal’s forehead and touched his chest, which made Reuenthal stay still for long enough that Mittermeyer could get his pants off. That done, Mittermeyer forced Reuenthal’s legs apart with his own, kneeling between his legs on the bed. Reuenthal watched him hungrily, but didn’t say a word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He spit into his hand just for the tiniest bit of ease, and stroked Reuenthal’s dick, making him jerk up into his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wolf,” he said, and for the first time that night, there was evidence in his voice of something other than his feigned control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Mittermeyer asked. He knew exactly what Reuenthal wanted, but he would make him ask for it. “Do you want Wen-li to suck your dick now?” Even as he suggested the alternative, he realized the idea had some allure, but he knew Reuenthal wouldn’t take it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He continued to stroke Reuenthal— with enough pressure and attention that it was more than teasing, but so slowly that it was less than satisfying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck me, Wolf,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Mittermeyer’s turn to feel warm and victorious. He looked to Yang, who was just watching the motion of Mittermeyer’s hand. “The lube is in the bottom drawer,” he said, and jerked his head at the bedside table. Yang did him the favor of retrieving it, then just watched as Mittermeyer used it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He and Reuenthal had found the most natural way of doing this long ago, and so it didn’t take long to prepare, circling Reuenthal’s hole with his fingers, then pressing them in, one and two, and finding along the way the spot that made Reuenthal jerk in surprise, always a fresh feeling no matter how many times they had done this in the past.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he was ready, Mittermeyer pulled his hand free and said, “On your knees.” His tone brooked no disagreement, and Reuenthal didn’t argue, though this was not their usual habit. Reuenthal knelt before him, and Mittermeyer pushed him down to his hands and knees. Reuenthal understood what Mittermeyer intended, but Yang seemed not to, and was silently watching, reclining on the bed with his head propped up on his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer positioned himself behind Reuenthal, who said something that might have been a request to hurry up, and Mittermeyer complied. It always felt incredible to fuck Reuenthal, even at the very beginning when he went slowly. Reuenthal made a noise of pleasure, and Mittermeyer dug his fingers into Reuenthal’s hips as he thrust all the way in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wen-li,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm?” Yang asked. He idly reached out and touched Reuenthal’s face with his fingertips, smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me— please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Mittermeyer said. He was barely moving behind Reuenthal, waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you insist,” Yang said. But maybe he was just as pleased to hear what Reuenthal wanted as Mittermeyer was. He took his time in getting up from his lazy sprawl to kneel in front of Reuenthal, who looked up at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before he did anything else, Yang picked up the circle of palm leaves and placed it gently on Reuenthal’s head. When he did it, somehow it was less of a crowning and more of a benediction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two images superimposed themselves in Mittermeyer’s mind, one dangerous, the other gentle, and he wished he could see Reuenthal’s face. He could only feel the tension in Reuenthal’s body, and in his own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang cupped Reuenthal’s cheek, and Reuenthal opened his mouth. Yang slipped his fingers inside, and Reuenthal sucked on them for a moment, until Mittermeyer said, “Come on, Wen-li.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang relented— he </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> capable of teasing too— and let Reuenthal take his dick in his mouth. He gave a breathy sigh of pleasure, and Mittermeyer took that as enough permission to really move, thrusting into Reuenthal, who made his own muffled noise. Yang’s hands settled on his head, stroking his hair near his ears and lightly holding him in place. Yang didn’t need to move much— Mittermeyer’s movements pushed Reuenthal against him, and Yang only needed to remain steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meeting Yang’s eyes as they moved as one creature was electrifying— every time he saw Yang’s smile and matched it with his own, he felt a heady elation rise through him, a trill of real happiness that started low in his stomach and warmed him completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a little while, Reuenthal shifted his weight to one arm, and tried to reach for his own dick. Yang didn’t notice— he had closed his eyes and thrown his head back to the sky, anyway— but Mittermeyer did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He leaned forward onto Reuenthal with all his weight, forcing Reuenthal to drop his hand to retain his balance. Mittermeyer held Reuenthal’s shoulders now, rather than his hips. The new angle, which permitted only the shallowest of thrusts, still felt incredible, and Mittermeyer increased his tempo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m close,” he said, though he didn’t know who he was warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang opened his eyes, and realized that Mittermeyer’s head was now within his reach. He smiled at Mittermeyer and touched his cheek and lips with the broad stroke of his hand. This was enough to push Mittermeyer over the edge, and he came with a gasp, rocked by the sensation and clinging to Reuenthal until it was over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The feeling of Reuenthal moving against him quickly became too much in his over-sensitive state, and he had to pull out, though Reuenthal grumbled at the loss. Reuenthal redoubled his focus on Yang, and Mittermeyer stood and came around to the other side of the bed to stand behind him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang seemed close as well, his movements stiff and erratic. Mittermeyer pressed a kiss into the crook of his shoulder, and Yang let out a soft ‘oh’ of surprise. Mittermeyer’s hands snaked up his sides and slipped along his chest. As he nipped at Yang’s shoulder, he tweaked his nipples, and this was enough to set Yang off, finishing in Reuenthal’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal pulled back and coughed, and when Yang had come to his senses, he muttered a sheepish, “Sorry— I should have warned you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine,” Reuenthal said, sitting up on his knees. Mittermeyer climbed back onto the bed and pulled Reuenthal forward to kiss him, searching for and finding the taste of Yang in his mouth. Reuenthal moaned and again tried to reach for his own dick, but this time it was Yang who stopped him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you I wouldn’t forget,” Yang said as he pushed Reuenthal’s hand away and positioned himself between Reuenthal’s legs. Mittermeyer took both of Reuenthal’s arms and pinned them behind his back. Reuenthal resisted, wanting to touch Yang, but Mittermeyer wouldn’t let him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang had to lay down to get the best angle, and when Reuenthal tried to buck his hips into his mouth, he held down his legs. Between the two of them, he was pinned. It really wasn’t fair, Mittermeyer thought, but Reuenthal was certainly enjoying it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sight of Yang’s head bobbing up and down between Reuenthal’s legs, the smell of sex, the sound of Reuenthal’s heavy breathing and the way he said Yang’s name— “Wen-li,” with a kind of delirious reverence in it— made Mittermeyer almost dizzy, pushing every other thought out of his mind. In that moment, perhaps, he was happier than he had ever been, or ever would be again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal came suddenly, and Yang swallowed what he could, then wiped the rest on the back of his hand. He rolled over and rested his head on Reuenthal’s thigh, contentedly blinking up at Mittermeyer and Reuenthal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer let Reuenthal’s arms go, and he suddenly began to feel all the tension he was holding with the wave of tiredness that swept over him. He wished he could be as nonchalant as Yang, but instead he found himself moving on autopilot, getting up from the bed and stretching. He shook Yang’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” he said. “This isn’t Odin. You can’t stay the night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fantasy of the moment, as perfect as it had been, was over, and the real world of Iserlohn was seeping back in, dragging him back down to a sluggish reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal watched silently as Mittermeyer walked around and gathered their discarded clothes, sorting them by owner. His and Yang’s, aside from the difference in uniform rank, were impossible to tell apart, being approximately the same size, so he arbitrarily tossed a pair of pants and shirtsleeves towards Yang, who hadn’t moved. He wasn’t pretending to be asleep or anything like that. He just didn’t want to get up. Reuenthal was tangling his fingers in Yang’s hair, which wasn’t making it easier for him to move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mittermeyer went to the bathroom and cleaned himself up, then got dressed, checking himself in the wall mirror to make sure it wasn’t obvious what had been happening. He certainly still smelled like sex, and would need a shower, but couldn’t emerge from Reuenthal’s quarters </span>
<em>
<span>wet</span>
</em>
<span> without attracting undue attention, so that would have to wait until he got back to his own ship.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, Yang,” he said. “Get dressed. I’ll walk you out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of his own voice grated on him, the instinctual way he switched back to ‘Yang’ — and would switch to ‘Leigh’ after they went out the door— making him wince. He knew he was spoiling it, and he hated himself for it, but he didn’t have a choice. He couldn’t really meet Reuenthal’s eyes anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now that he was finished getting dressed, he had nowhere to put his nervous energy, so he was forced to sit back down on the edge of the bed. This, perhaps, was what convinced Yang to slowly sit up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” he said. “I’ll still be around for a couple days before I’m shipped back to Odin.” He turned the pair of pants Mittermeyer had tossed at him rightside out and began to get dressed. He yawned. “I’ll see you tomorrow.” Yang’s voice was pragmatically cheerful, in the kind of way that only he could be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow,” Reuenthal echoed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang slipped on his shirtsleeves but didn’t bother buttoning them, and just pulled his uniform jacket down over top, messily tucking the trailing white ends of his shirt into his pants. He was a sight, but one disheveled captain probably wouldn’t be too much of a problem. Yang didn’t have far to go to his temporary quarters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he was dressed, he leaned towards Reuenthal, gave him one last quick kiss. “Tomorrow,” he repeated. He glanced at Mittermeyer. “You said you’d walk me out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Mittermeyer said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang vanished into the bathroom for a moment to wash off his face— Mittermeyer could hear the water run. In the moment he was alone with Reuenthal, Mittermeyer said, very quietly, “Maybe you didn’t push too far.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reuenthal nodded, and then Yang came out of the bathroom, smiling tiredly. Mittermeyer stood up, brushed Reuenthal’s shoulder with his fingertips as he went, and followed Yang to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you tomorrow,” he said, giving one last backwards look at Reuenthal. Repeating it like a mantra.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He and Yang walked out of Reuenthal’s flagship, then into the corridors of Iserlohn, always lit to a daytime brightness regardless of what shift it was. It was disorienting, and Yang wavered on his feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Mittermeyer’s own flagship was not far from where they were, he walked Yang all the way to his temporary rooms on Iserlohn, the ones that were reserved for soldiers waiting to change posts. The hallway outside Yang’s tiny quarters was empty and dead silent, save for their footsteps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He wondered what Yang was thinking, during their walk. He couldn’t quite read Yang’s mind like he could predict Reuenthal’s thoughts, since Yang always seemed to be operating on a different level than the one Mittermeyer had access to. They didn’t say anything to each other— perhaps there wasn’t anything else that could be said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right outside Yang’s door, they stopped, and Yang tried three different keycode combinations to the door before he remembered the correct one and it clicked open. He stuck his foot in the door so that it wouldn’t close, and he turned to Mittermeyer with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Leigh, I—” Mittermeyer began. But Yang took a quick look up and down the hallway, decided it was safe, and pulled Mittermeyer forward by his jacket to place the briefest kiss on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodnight, Wolf,” he said. “I </span>
<em>
<span>will </span>
</em>
<span>see you tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang always did have the one thing to do and say that would lift the haze of doubt from his mind. Perhaps that was a bad thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Mittermeyer said. “Tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yang smiled and slipped inside his quarters, closing the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The clearing of the fog lasted until Mittermeyer was in his own rooms, until after he showered, until he lay in bed, staring at the black ceiling above him.</span>

<p>
<span>It was nearly two in the morning by the time that the last guests were convinced to make their exit from the Westpfale mansion after the wedding. Magdalena took pity on her servants and whispered into the ear of her butler that, as soon as the guests were gone, everyone could just go— the cleanup of the party did not have to take place until tomorrow. Although the action was altruistic, it was for the strange and selfish motive of wanting the house to herself. After watching the headlights of the cars depart out into the rainy night, she stood in the center of the ballroom, surveying the wreckage of the event. While there had still been guests, the glitz had remained, but now that they were gone, the only things that she could see all around were the dirty dishes that littered the tables, the napkins and trash that had fallen to the ground, the scuffmarks all over the once-bright dancing floor, and all the tablecloths that had been pristine and were now rumpled beyond repair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her own footsteps echoed strangely as she walked around with light feet. Her toes ached from dancing so much in her shoes, but that didn’t stop her from still taking a nimble few leaps, now that the dance floor was empty. She watched her own reflection the window as she did. In motion, she still looked good. Her dress, at least, had stayed immaculate, and if her hair had come loose from its structure, that only made it look better as it fluttered behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hank came back into the ballroom— he had gone out to say his last goodbyes to departing friends, but now he sat back down at one of the empty tables and watched Magdalena jump. He propped his head on his hands, silent, a red flush in his cheeks and a shine in his eyes from tiredness and alcohol.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was very drunk already, and she knew that, but that didn’t stop her from retrieving half a bottle of wine and two clean glasses from the bar area. The bartender was long gone, but the bottles had been purchased in full ahead of time, so they all remained. She made a fool of herself— balancing the heavy wine bottle on her head and taking delicate little flouncing steps towards Hank. It was the kind of exercise she had done as a child in ballet class. The motions were as embedded into her body as breathing was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smiled at her— very indulging. Too indulging, perhaps. She set the glasses down on the table before him, tossing some crumpled napkins out of the way, and poured them both drinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, Maggie,” he said, which was a very funny thing for him to say. But he was very drunk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, Hank,” she replied. Saying this felt unreasonably hilarious to her, and she tried to stifle her own giggles as she picked up her wine glass. “Oh, I am drunk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prosit!” Hank said as he waved his own glass in her general direction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you should stop me from drinking more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would I do that?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you just going to let me do whatever I want?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He seemed stymied by this question. “Probably. Shouldn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hank,” she trilled, drawing out the vowel. “You shouldn’t say that!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s true, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed again. “If it is, you shouldn’t admit to it. People will think I’ve whipped you like a dog.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He shook his head and raised his glass towards her again. “Doesn’t matter what anybody thinks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This concept swirled around in her mind for a moment, but it was slippery, and so she put it down. Thinking about other people was dangerous to her mood, no matter what Hank said about them not mattering. So, she didn’t think about them, at least not right now. “And do you think that I’m going to let you do whatever you like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He put down his glass and propped his chin on his hands, looking at her and smiling. “Maybe,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmph,” she said. “I don’t think so.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not even in the house all by ourselves,” she said. “I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hank looked around, as if realizing for the first time that he had sent all his friends home. Maybe he was just looking for the servants. “Everyone’s gone?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everyone’s gone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s alright, then,” he said with a yawn. “I’ll stop worrying, if it’s just you.” Even though the sentence was phrased with the simplicity that alcohol loaned him, the way that Hank tilted his head at her communicated that he knew what he was saying, and that he meant something else by it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Were you worried?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smiled at her, and the new tightness in the expression said enough that the question itself wasn’t worth answering. He must feel the same as she did, she realized. Better to not think of anyone else, not right now, not right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tried to change the tone. “Well, I don’t know why you were,” she said. “Of all people, you’d think I can be trusted to throw a great party.” She lifted her glass in a grand gesture towards the ruins of the room, then drank half of it, putting it back down with a thunk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hank reached across the table to take her hand. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alone in the house all night and all you want to do is hold my hand? For shame, Hank,” she said, and pulled her hand away from his.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood. Hands on her hips, as much as she could with her dress flowing around her. “If you want something from me, you’ll have to come and get it.” And she took a few skips away from him to illustrate her point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hank laughed. He covered his face with his hand, flushing red. “You’re going to make me chase you? I was never any good at tag, or any of the time I had to run in school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then I’ll win,” she said. “And you’ll be very sad about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He couldn’t seem to stop laughing, and when he stood, he stumbled, having trouble getting his bearings. It only took half a step for him to blindly start reaching out his hand towards her, but she was lithe, and slipped out of the way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on, Hank! You can do better than that!” She skipped backwards, trying not to tangle her legs in her dress. It was a heroic act of coordination her her part. Surely, she was drunker than Hank, and he was stumbling over his own clumsy feet trying to reach her, while she was traipsing out of the way, even encumbered by the layers of fabric as she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was half a lap around the ball room before Hank seemed to realize that she really wasn’t going to let him catch her unless he was running, so, in the last dash to the door, he picked up the pace. Magdalena shrieked with laughter as his hands grazed the fabric of her sleeve, but he didn’t want to grasp her dress and risk ripping it, so she slid out from under his touch, and made it out of the ballroom into the dark hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She caught a glimpse of herself in the long gilt mirror on the hallway wall, lit dimly from the golden glow that spilled out from the ballroom. She looked like a ghostly bride, there in the dark, and she sped forwards, trying to outrun the image. Hank was behind her by five meters or so. He had found his footing, but then was slowed by banging his shin on a piece of furniture he had forgotten about, and he let out a yelp and a set of heavier footsteps as he tried to recover.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She led him on a mad dash through the whole first floor of the house, through all the rooms so dark that neither of them could see where they were going except for the feeble light that came in from the windows and the lights tucked into the landscaping outside the house. She was laughing, every time she changed direction to stymie him, but he was too out of breath to do anything but follow her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hank, whose legs were longer, gained on her sporadically, but he was always reacting rather than setting the pace, and so it was easy for her to make him fall a few steps behind by taking an unexpected turn into a room and weaving a circuitous path through the furniture, or by letting doors shut in his face. She could have run forever, and maybe he could have, too, and she had no intention of slowing down or stopping. She wouldn’t stop until he caught her. That was just what she decided would have to happen, now that she had started running. Who would she be if she gave up and let him catch her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, Hank!” she taunted over her shoulder as she slipped into the library. The room was almost pitch black, but she remembered the location of the armchair, the one she had once pinned Hank to so that she could kiss him. The memory was so funny, she circled the chair and rested her fingertips on the upholstery as she did. Hank, too, knew where the furniture was in this room, and he tried to corner her as she ended up behind the chair, spreading his arms so that she couldn’t pass back out into the hall. But she duked under his arm, and slipped behind him. Hank turned, and took one fumbling step.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His dizzy foot landed directly on the train of her dress, and this stopped them both in their tracks for a single instant as the fabric made a terrible ripping sound, before momentum carried them both down to the ground, hard, Magdalena falling first and Hank ending up on top of her a moment later. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The carpet of the library was soft, and her elbows didn’t take too much of a beating as she landed on her outstretched forearms. Hank was heavy and warm on top of her, though his head only made it up to the small of her back. In the moment of stupefaction after hitting the ground, she could just hear his rapid breathing, and then he started to flail, trying to disentangle himself from the fabric he too was now trapped in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you alright?” he asked, trying to get off her. “I’m so sorry—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Magdalena, heedless of her dress now, rolled over, further entangling her legs, but was happy to find Hank on his hands and knees above her. She reached a lazy hand up and grabbed a fistfull of his hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You caught me,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, right,” he said. “I didn’t think you’d let me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say another word, Hank.” She pulled his hair to drag him down, and he seemed to collapse, his whole weight ending up on her intentionally. She kissed him, nipping at his lips before she let him really begin, but she did let him begin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Unlike the last time she had kissed him in the library, there was no trace of unfamiliarity in his movements. He had told her, once, that her kiss had been his first, and she was pleased enough to have that, even if there was some part of her that was jealous of everything else. And she was pleased enough to have him here now— that was something for her alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cupped his cheeks, and pulled on his earlobes with pinching fingers, which made him stop kissing her in confusion, which made her laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on, Hank!” she said. “I can’t move enough to bite you, so I’m settling.” And she tugged on his ear again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not the settling type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No?” she asked. “I married you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t realize a count and a flag officer was settling,” he mumbled, though he was joking— she knew as well as he did that he had never wanted to be a count or a flag officer, and both titles meant less than nothing to him. He moved to press his lips to her forehead, to litter kisses along her closed eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is,” she insisted. She wormed her arm beneath his so that she could get her ice cold hand beneath his uniform shirt, which made him twitch and shiver. “I was sure that a dashing rogue would steal me away. A real scoundrel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am a scoundrel,” Hank insisted. “I thought you knew that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you’re respectable in society,” she said. “It cancels out.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He buried his head in the crook of her neck and kissed her there through his muffled huff of laughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you settled for me, then,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers trailed over his stomach, the little of him that she could reach in their uncomfortable position on the floor, until she wiggled to sit up. He rolled off of her, laying on his back, just looking up at her while she stood. While it would have been very funny to step on him (she had the childish impulse), she just said, “Are you trying to peek underneath my dress down there, Hank?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He laughed and threw his arm over his face, hiding his eyes in his elbow. Magdalena leaned down, grabbed his hand, and hauled him up to stand. He went up willingly, though he swayed on his feet, and leaned far too much of his weight onto her, almost dragging her back down to the ground. She was not going to spend her wedding night on the floor of the library, so, even drunk, they would both have to make it to bed. She put her hands on his chest and pushed him backwards, back out of the library, down the hall, towards the central staircase.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He went willingly, not even looking behind himself, trusting her not to bump him into anything. She took the opportunity to start pulling his shirt off as she directed him through the house, which she tossed away onto the floor to be dealt with later. On the stairs they stopped halfway up so she could undo his belt, and he had lost his pants by the time they were at the top step. Outside the bedroom, she stepped on his toes to get him to remove his shoes, which he took a lot of effort to do without untying them— he couldn’t bend down or move at all, since she had embraced him to stick her hands down the back of his briefs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was surprised at how unselfconscious he was. For some reason, she had expected him to be nervous or shy. She didn’t know why she had that feeling, but she supposed that she was pleased to find it had been incorrect. He didn’t mind her touches, and snuck in a few of his own, stroking her neck or her side, or brushing her hair from her face when she gave him the brief opportunity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally made it into the bedroom, he was completely naked before her— he had interpreted her roving hands as a signal to shimmy out of his underwear, and had done so, though she hadn’t exactly intended it. She found it very funny that she was fully dressed and he didn’t have a stitch of clothing left on him, and she had a momentary temptation to keep it that way, to have him fuck her in the ruins of her wedding dress. But as she ran her hands with feather-light touches all down his chest, trailing her fingers through the sparse hair that grew below his navel, he was touching her shoulders, and she suddenly wanted all of the fabric out of the way, as quickly as possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hank, if you do not get me out of this dress this </span>
<em>
<span>instant</span>
</em>
<span>—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was unfortunate that he was so drunk and the garment was so complicated. It took significantly more than an instant for him to figure out the ties that cinched the bodice tightly to her frame, and for every inch of string that loosened and let a little more air into her chest, she grew more and more impatient and hungry. All her tiredness had fallen away, and she was frustrated by Hank being behind her now— nothing for her to touch, nothing for her to look at. She made some kind of stupidly, wretchedly needy sound, and he hurried, to get the dress in a state that it could be removed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When he judged it loose enough, he surprised her by hiking up the skirt and slipping both his hands beneath, sliding them up her sides as he tugged and lifted the dress over her head. It was incredible that he could coordinate such a slick move with how drunk he was, but Magdalena quickly stopped thinking about how smooth he was being, and just reveled in the feeling of his warm and broad hands on her skin, so different from the inhuman sensation of her dress’ fabric that it was like being touched for the first time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was cold in the bedroom— the kind of chill that came with the intermittent use of the furnace in spring, not quite warm enough to leave it off, not quite cold enough to run it all the time. She shivered as the dress fell to the floor, and she leaned back against Hank’s warm chest, reaching behind herself to pull him closer. He cupped her breasts in his hands, which felt so good that Magdalena had to stop him so that she could turn around and kiss him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hank,” she said again, and pulled him back to fall onto the bed, situating herself on the warm red duvet. He followed her, and for a minute she luxuriated in kissing him, letting her hands wander as they may, breathing heavily whenever she broke away, tangling their legs together and pressing as closely into his skin as she could. His movements were gentle but steady, and when she eventually whined into his mouth to get him to move further, he obeyed without hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled onto her back, and though she expected him to fuck her immediately— it wasn’t like she wasn’t ready for it! — he kissed his way down her body and marked her thighs until she took a handful of his hair and pulled so that he would hurry up and get where he was going. He laughed at her. Presumably, he pulled his hair so much on his own time that her mild frustrations had no effect on him. But then she felt his warm and heavy breathing move between her legs, and his head settled there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What he lacked in technique, he made up for in enthusiasm. She knew what thoughts were probably going through his head— they were certainly thinking the same thing— it was difficult to know what to do when faced with unfamiliar territory. It had always felt very natural and instinctual for her to touch Ingrid, or any other woman, but it was the memory of herself between Ingrid’s legs that flashed through her mind now— so long ago. And Hank— if she had a dick— but she didn’t, and they would have to make do. And it didn’t really matter if he was clumsy— it felt so good even if it left her wanting more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts were incoherent and jumbled, and she squeezed her eyes shut and tried to grid herself into Hank’s face. </span>
<em>
<span>Use teeth</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought, but she had lost the ability to form words to make the request aloud. Hank circled her entrance with a finger, asking permission with his slowness, and when she made a noise that couldn’t have possibly meant anything, he slipped it in. Her fist in his hair tightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thing about lying there on her back, it wasn’t really the vulnerability of it, she didn’t mind that at all, but she found herself frustrated at the chill and empty feeling of her upper body. She felt like her torso was too loose, and would float up to the sky if there was nothing to hold it down. She needed something heavier than air, or she would lose her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hank—” she finally managed. “I need you on top of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took a moment for her words to register for him, and he pulled back and sat up. “Are you sure?” he asked. His tone made it clear that this was a practical ask, not one that was concerned about her feelings. That made it better. “I wouldn’t want to get you pregnant— I mean—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His hand still rested in the slickness between her legs distractingly, his index finger idly swiping up and down. She realized that he would be perfectly happy not fucking her in the usual style— it occurred to her now that probably with Oscar he would rarely go that far, just out of convenience. He was undemanding, and accustomed to other things. It was endearing, in its way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s taken care of,” she said, and closed her eyes. “You should know that being noble and having money does have its perks. You can get what you need.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, right,” he said. “I didn’t think—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a mood killer of a discussion, and so she sat up and kissed him again, tasting herself on the corners of his mouth. When she reached for his dick, it was his turn to make a needy little noise, which she appreciated more than she thought she would. She was sure that she was fumbling it just as clumsily as he had touched her, but he clearly didn’t mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned back after a minute, tugging him down with her. He knelt between her knees, and she wrapped her legs around him. “Come on, Hank,” she said, playfully, now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t take too much encouragement. He positioned himself and entered her, so slowly that she had to resist the urge to try to drag him forward— she let him take his time. And she was glad she did, because watching his face and his expression change from one of concentration to a look of total overwhelm was very rewarding. She tightened her legs around him, and he sank to his elbows on the bed, their chests together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt wonderful to have his weight atop her. He wasn’t particularly rhythmic, and this wasn’t a position that suited too much speed anyway, but that was okay. They didn’t say much— she mumbled his name incoherently a few times, and he let out something that might have been a laugh, and kissed her forehead, nuzzling her sweaty hair away from her face. He told her when he was close, and she guided his hand down to stroke her clit— the positioning was awkward, but just a little of his touch was enough to get her off at this point, and she came, tensing around him and clutching his back, holding him even tighter, trying to meld their skins together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It stopped him from pulling out immediately, which he made motion to do. She kept him pinned with her legs. “Don’t you dare,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” he said gamely, and smiled at her. How he could be so coherent, she didn’t know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His flow had been thrown off, so it took a minute or so more for him to come. She knew when it happened by the way he went stiff and jerky, and then still, letting himself drop down onto her with his whole weight. She kissed his neck and ran her hand through his hair, gently this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was really good,” she said. “Thank you, Hank.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded, but was quiet, perhaps still just recovering. She knew she should get up and go clean herself up in the bathroom, but she liked having him in her arms. By the time that he rolled off of her, she had given up any intention of getting out of bed, and she just clumsily tried to move the sheets so that they could be under them, rather than atop them. Hank helped after a moment of realizing what she was doing, or at least didn’t lay there flat blocking any attempts for her to unpin the fabric beneath him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They settled down quietly in the dark bedroom, with his back against her chest, her arms wrapped around him. It was quiet and peaceful. Even after some time, she could tell by his somewhat irregular breathing that he wasn’t asleep yet. She stroked his side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know that’s not my name, right?” he said after a while. “Hank.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she said. “I guessed that as soon as I met you. I’m sure pretty much everyone knows that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think that’s true.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well.” She pressed her forehead to the back of his neck, the bridge of her nose along his spine. “Even if they don’t— it is your name now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.” There was so much contained in that syllable, and none of it was something that she could fully grasp. He was silent for a while. “You’re not going to ask what my real name is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed his shoulder. Now that she knew what she was looking for, she could feel the tension in his frame, the way he held his arms, the way the muscles in his back were stiff with it. She wanted his looseness back, for him to not worry about her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you tell it to Oskar before or after you fucked him?” she asked, which made him laugh a little. That was her goal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Before, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He can keep your secret, Hank,” she said. “I’m not jealous of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He let out a shuddering breath, and she realized that maybe he was crying. In the dark, she tried to reach for his face, but he took her hand and squeezed it.</span>

<span>On the night of the fourteenth, despite there being a clamor of people and things that wanted his attention, Martin dismissed all except the most urgent. He dealt with those in a perfunctory way: most problems that had arisen at this juncture were not problems that could be solved, and so if someone came to him with that, all Martin could do was lay his hand gently on their shoulder and say as much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll face trouble when it arises,” was his refrain. “Go get some sleep— you’ll regret being tired in the morning if you keep yourself up with this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The people he said this to had no choice but to accept his words, or at least they didn’t argue with him, because they slipped out of his classroom-office without protest. When the last of them— Otto, one of the most high strung men in the camp— had gone, Martin slid down in his seat and sighed, glancing over at Siegfried, who was sorting through their supply of stolen guns and ensuring that all of their check-lights went on and that their energy packs were full. He had them lined up against the wall, the rifles like little soldiers themselves, and the handguns placed in a line before them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think I’m making a mistake, Sieg?” Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In what way?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Telling everyone not to worry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t hear you say that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not in those words.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“People want reassurance,” Sieg said. “They know you can’t solve every problem— and they know you’re not going to call off tomorrow— but they want to hear you. It’s good for you to talk to them, say what you need to say.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know why.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg raised one of the rifles to check its sights, then put it down on his lap to fiddle with one of its mechanisms. “And I don’t know why you’re asking me,” he said. His voice was his usual placid one, but Martin could read the wry humor into it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have any problems you want me to tell you that I won’t solve, Sieg?” Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He craned his neck to look behind him at Martin. “I think your comrades are a little jealous of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In what way?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here and they’re not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin’s face twisted. “It was a mistake that made me important to them. Anybody else could be me instead, if they happened to have been in the right place at the right time… I’m a poor substitute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think that’s true,” Sieg said. “But even if it was, it doesn’t matter. They need you now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you, Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t know why he had asked that— it was a stupid question, and Sieg’s answer was a lie. He knew perfectly well that he didn’t need him: they had lived together for years with that shared understanding, the invisible wall between them. The fact that Sieg was here now was not so much a dismantling of that wall but an acknowledgement of it, a coming to terms with the difference between need and want, between requirement and desire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They could have both lived, or died, without the other— they had understood as much when Martin came back to Sieg’s apartment. It was somehow much more precious that Sieg had chosen to be here, regardless of need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need you here too,” Martin said. “If they’re jealous, it’s because they don’t understand that. I’m just as human…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Sieg said. He finished checking the last rifle over, and leaned it back up against the wall. “But I wouldn’t want to keep you from them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin stood from his tiny child’s seat and stretched, feeling the tension in his back. He reached out a hand to help Sieg to his feet, which he took despite the fact that he could easily pull Martin to the ground if he wasn’t careful. They stood in the dark classroom for a moment, saying nothing and not letting go of each other’s hands, and then Sieg put his other hand on Martin’s shoulder and gave him a gentle push towards the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on— they need to see you more than I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It may have been true— it was true— but that was trouble with want. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They headed back towards the gymnasium together, the stage-light illuminating the hallway and paling the beams of their flashlights. Inside, the mood was strange— someone was playing a guitar and some were singing along, while others were talking loudly. It was with the sense that all this was being done to ward off doom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg waved Martin off and went to sit on the gym mat that had ended up as his own. It was by far the thickest one, and therefore the most comfortable bed, but it smelled most overwhelmingly of mildew and sweat, so most people had opted for the thinner but less ragged options. After months of sleeping on floors in whatever buildings they could find, most of Martin’s crew was inured to the discomfort of a hard floor, and were happy enough with their sleeping bags.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fritz, the freckled sixteen year old who had been appointed in charge of their food supply in camp, approached Martin as he stood on the outside of the circle of light that held the guitar player, tunelessly and quietly singing the words of the old song. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Martin,” he said, and held out something wrapped in paper. “For you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s this?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Found it the other day,” he said. “Left in a teacher’s desk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The paper wrapped object was thin and rectangular— very clearly now a chocolate bar, even though Fritz had tried to disguise that fact. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You keep it,” he said. “Share it with Karl.” He nodded at the guitar player, who was so engrossed in his playing and the singing of the few sitting in front of him that he didn’t notice Martin referring to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Knew you’d say that,” Fritz said, though he didn’t sound too put out. “You’re hopeless, Comrade.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Martin said. He patted Fritz on the shoulder, who shook his head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin wandered away to talk to the other groups gathered on the floor of the gym, sharing greetings and gentle smiles. He could feel Sieg’s eyes on him the whole time, as he sat by himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin’s thoughts wandered back to their shared childhood— this moment seemed like a strange inversion of the way they had been as kids. It was Sieg who had always been the one in their school to provide help and reassurance to the other kids who had wanted it, and it had been Martin alone on the sidelines watching. This had been true even after they became fast friends, and more than fast friends. Perhaps it was years of association with Sieg that had given Martin the ability to play this role here— but Sieg would never take credit for teaching Martin anything, even if it was true. The thought made him smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, the sounds in the gym died down as more and more people took his advice to try to get some sleep, and Martin went around to turn off the big lights. As the last went off, he switched his flashlight on, swishing its beam across the ground, illuminating the faces and prone bodies of his friends and comrades. They looked peaceful, in the whispering dark, and he lingered on the sight for perhaps a little too long— an ache growing in his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He eventually went to lay down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just me, Sieg,” Martin whispered when laid down on the mat and brushed against Sieg’s back, though he didn’t need to be told that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The foam mat was almost three feet thick, meant for cushioning high falls, but it was soft enough that the weights of their bodies hollowed out a cavity in it, and Martin ended up sliding down next to Sieg, pressed together by the geometry of it. The warmth of his body pushed every other thought out of his mind, and he let himself enjoy the pressure of his chest on his back. The scent of his soft hair against his nose freed him from the smell of the mat they lay on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was pitch black in the gymnasium, except for the occasional flashes of someone illuminating their watch face to check the time, or getting up with a flashlight to go to the bathroom. The room was filled with the sounds of breathing and shuffling as people got comfortable, and the low whispers of someone making a comment to their neighbor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg rolled over to face Martin. Though they couldn’t see each other in the dark, Martin could feel his breath on his face. He touched Martin’s cheek with the lightest touch of his fingertips, which made him shiver. He traced from beneath Martin’s eye, down towards his lips, where he rested his fingertips for a moment. When he withdrew his hand, Martin fumbled in the dark for it, but found instead that Sieg was leaning in to kiss him, and so his hand ended up in his hair, tangling and pulling as Sieg’s lips found his.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin opened his mouth to let Sieg kiss him more deeply, and when he did he was startled to find that Sieg’s mouth was full of candy: a hard and bitter square of dark chocolate not even half melted on his tongue. Even if he had wanted to, which he didn’t, Martin couldn’t resist or complain— they had to be imperceptibly quiet there in the dark room. So he let Sieg push the chocolate into his mouth, kissing him deeply all the while. It was an overwhelming feeling, like his mouth had become the locus of all the pleasure in the universe. He hadn’t had chocolate in months, and hadn’t kissed anyone so deeply in far longer than that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They savored the candy together until it was gone, and Martin heard Sieg fiddle with the wrapper to get out another square. He reached over and stilled his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not here—” he breathed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg nodded, and they both got up from the mat. Martin stumbled in the darkness on the unsteady foam, and Sieg caught him around the waist, saving him from falling over onto a sleeper on the floor just a step away. Martin fumbled for his flashlight and turned it on. When he turned, the beam illuminated Sieg’s face for a moment, all the flush on his cheeks and the trace of chocolate still on his lip. Martin touched his own lip to indicate where it was, and Sieg’s tongue darted out to lick it clean. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin’s face must have also been horribly red with desire, and he hastily turned to leave the gym, leading Sieg out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The school was small, and there were very few good places to go. Sieg almost seemed to not care where they went. As Martin tried to lead him away, he stopped him with his hand on his shoulder and kissed him again, right there in the middle of the hallway, pulling Martin’s shirt out from its messy tuck so that he could slide his hands up his sides, his fingers stopping at each one of Martin’s ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmm, Sieg—” he protested, though it wasn’t much of a protest, since all he wanted was to let him continue to kiss him. He wanted to toss his head back and let the red stubble of Sieg’s several-days unshaved beard scrape across his neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you,” Sieg said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not in the hallway—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can love you in the hallway,” Sieg said— but that was a funny enough thought that he smiled and pulled back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Martin said. “There’s no rush.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was not true, and they both knew it. It was past midnight already, and they would be leaving early in the morning, well before the sun rose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have time,” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg nodded, and let Martin lead him forward again. He turned the hallway corner, and switched off their flashlight— they were now too near the windows for it to be safe. He navigated by memory, hand in hand together, pulling him along until he found the school nurse’s office.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lock on the door was broken— they had broken it when they first arrived, cleaning it out of all the first aid supplies that they could possibly use— but the skinny room was otherwise untouched. A camp bed without sheets was shielded from the rest of the room with a thin fabric curtain, which Martin pulled back. The bed was beneath a similarly curtained window, and he pulled back those too, letting the thin slivers of starlight in. Not enough light to see anything except Sieg’s vague shadow before him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He sat down on the bed, and it creaked when Sieg followed, meant for the weight of an ailing fifth grader, not two grown men. Martin pulled Seig’s head towards his own, their noses bumping in the darkness. His own pulse was sounding in his ears, roaring and making him lightheaded. Sieg undid the buttons on his shirt and pushed it off his shoulders, and Martin’s hands tangled in his hair as he kissed his neck and then his chest, nuzzling his face across Martin’s skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin was pressed into the corner of the room, leaning back against the intersection of the walls. The painted concrete behind him was cold, and goosebumps rose on his flesh. He wanted to clutch Sieg’s head— that fiery ball of warmth— to his chest and hold it there. Or he wanted Sieg’s full weight on top of him, or he wanted a thousand million other things. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Slow down,” Martin whispered. “We have time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was saying it for himself more than Sieg, but he obeyed nevertheless, slowing his near-frantic kisses to simply rest his forehead against Martin’s stomach. Martin carded his fingers through his hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He moved deliberately slowly, trying to calm the beating of his heart, trying to savor the moment. He held Sieg’s head in his lap like he held the sun in his hands, and stroked his thumbs across his cheeks. If it was sweat or tears that gathered on his fingers, he couldn’t tell in the darkness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me see you,” he said. “Come here, Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He sat up, though there wasn’t enough light to see him by. That didn’t matter. Martin reached for his shirt and tugged it off him, and it was his turn to touch Sieg, memorizing every inch of him with his fingertips: the stubble at his neck, the hollow of his throat, the rapid rise and fall of his chest, and the fuzz of hair that trailed down his stomach. Where Martin was bony, Sieg was warm and full of life, and in the blackness he pictured the blood beneath his skin, coursing through his veins like fire, illuminating him completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin undid his belt, though he couldn’t get Sieg’s pants off without him getting up, and when Sieg moved, he instead pushed Martin down so that he was over top of him on the narrow bed. He did, at least, manage to kick his pants off as he went, and so his legs were bare as he tangled them with Martin’s, laying his full weight on him like a blanket. Martin made a noise of contentment and continued to let his hands wander as Sieg resumed kissing him indiscriminately: marking his neck in a way that made him gasp, and then nipping at his ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It seemed that he was frantically animated— like he kept his mouth and hands in motion, always serving some purpose, because if he let them still, something terrible would happen. What that terrible thing was, Martin couldn’t fully parse out, but he understood. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>We have all the time in the world</span>
</em>
<span>, he thought again, but didn’t say it. Sieg’s hands slid down his sides, then undid his belt, pushing his pants down. Martin lifted his hips to help, and usually, he remembered, this would have made him say something funny, but tonight he was silent as Martin kicked his pants the rest of the way off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was perhaps the feeling of nothing remaining between them that finally stilled Siegfried’s near-frantic motion. He melted against him, tucking his head into Martin’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin wanted to ask if he was alright, but he knew what the answer was, and furthermore knew that Sieg was so silent because if he spoke it would come out too thickly— a voice trapped on the edge of tears. He could feel it in the heat of his face, burning against his shoulder, and the way he swallowed over and over, trying to clear the lump in his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He rubbed Sieg’s back with one hand. “If I had known you would come find me, I wouldn’t have stayed at your apartment the other night,” Martin murmured into his hair. “I’m sorry to do this to you twice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Funny thing to apologize for,” he managed to say. “More time together— that’s all I wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And even if they had known the difference between last and second to last, they would have savored it the same, it would have hurt just as much. If there had been a clock ticking down between them, showing the number of times they have left to meet and part— it was knowing the number that was painful, not the meetings and partings themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have time,” Martin said again. “We have time, Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He felt strangely peaceful— even moreso than he had the other night. Although they both knew that what they were doing here was preparation for the worst, Martin believed fully in the possibility of success, and that carried him past fear. If Sieg had been anyone else, his unhappiness would have been enough for Martin to tell him to stay home, to not follow the group tomorrow, if he believed there was no hope. But this was Sieg, and even if his convictions and hopes only extended as far as the man directly in front of him, he would stay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that was an unkind way of seeing him, and one that was at odds with the way Martin felt when he looked at him, and felt his arms around him. He could be drunk on convictions and sober on love, or drunk on love and sober on convictions, and being with Sieg made him feel the latter. With his arms around him, his breath in his ear, his warm and comforting weight on his chest, Martin in that moment might have traded his whole cadre for him alone, if anyone had asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Drunk on love was a dangerous thing to be, but permissible for a short while, in the time they had. It would wear off by the morning, and he would have his convictions beneath his feet again— they were a much more solid ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin gently pushed Sieg off him, making him sit up. It was unfortunate that they had already raided the nurse’s office for first aid supplies: there was no longer any vaseline or similar that they could scavenge to use, so they would have to keep whatever they did relatively simple. Maybe that was for the best. His efforts to remain composed might be undone if he let Sieg truly unravel him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg’s hand was on his arm, waiting, trying to feel what his intentions were. The bed was so thin and uncomfortable, but Martin eventually pushed his legs apart, then settled himself between them, wrapping his legs around Sieg’s waist. He pulled him forward with his hand in his hair, pressed their foreheads together, and then smiled against his lips before kissing him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was a very comfortable and easy position, and when Sieg reached between them to take both their cocks together in his broad hand, Martin made a noise of pleasure. He kept his hand tangled in Sieg’s hair, kissing him so deeply that breathing became a tricky thing to manage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg understood what he wanted, and he took things very slowly, drawing out the moment. It was an incredible sensation, like they were one creature rather than two, sharing every breath and feeling. It was not </span>
<em>
<span>more</span>
</em>
<span> intimate, exactly, than other things that they might have done, or had done in the past, but it was a uniquely symmetrical experience. The only difference between them was that Sieg was in control of the feeling, and therefore in control of Martin. Whenever Martin’s breath began to waver and he tossed his head back, too overwhelmed by the feeling of Sieg’s hand on his cock to even kiss him, Sieg took his hand away and placed fluttering kisses on his bared throat until he could breathe properly and begin again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was so easy for him to make him lose control, and he hoped that Sieg was enjoying playing this game with him. He was too quiet, his breath too controlled, and Martin couldn’t see his face in the darkness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next time he pulled his head away from Sieg’s, rather than letting him kiss his shoulder or his neck, Martin traced his fingertips along Sieg’s face. He held perfectly still, except for the inexorable movement of his hand between their legs, as he trailed a feather-light touch across his closed eyes, his cheeks, his lips. Although he was trying to see if Sieg was smiling, he found that his mouth was slightly open, and when his fingertip rested there for a moment, his tongue darted out to lick it, like he was tasting the last of the chocolate that lingered there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin laughed at the unexpected movement, and Sieg’s smile cracked open, and he laughed, too. Martin, suddenly unable to control himself at all, pressed his face into the crook of Sieg’s neck. There was a terrifying border between laughter and tears, and Martin found himself on the edge of it, trying to steady himself, trying not to let himself fall to the wrong side of that abyss and ruin the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sieg—” he said. “I love you so much.” It was about the only true thing he could manage to say, but it was the right thing to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg began to move faster, and this time Martin knew that he would not stop when Martin got close. The knowledge of that finality really hit him, and he squeezed his eyes shut, bracing his hands on Sieg’s thighs. He was so warm and alive, and Martin’s hands found easy purchase there, his fingers probably digging in hard enough to leave little bruises wherever they landed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg didn’t mind. His breathing was uneven, too, and he made small noises, sighs and moaning little hums.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He could hardly even feel the motion of Seig’s hand anymore— there was just a white hot feeling of pleasure, and he imagined that Sieg felt quite the same.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin came first, his whole body tensing, making a muffled cry into the crook of Sieg’s neck. The sudden wetness made the motion of Sieg’s hand easier and faster. Although the sudden overstimulation crossed the boundary from pleasure into something much more electric and overwhelming, almost unbearable, he didn’t try to pull away, and just muffled his open mouthed gasps on Sieg’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sieg finished not long after: Martin felt him tense against him, and shudder, and then his cum landed somewhere on his chest, warm and wet. The motion of his hand slowed to nothing, Sieg now equally twitchy and overstimulated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of them moved for a long time, not until they had caught their breaths and their heartbeats slowed. Neither of them wanted to move, even after that. But Martin uncurled his hands from where they had been digging into Kircheis’s legs, and trailed the flat of his palm down Sieg’s chest, resting it over his heart. Sieg picked up his hand and kissed it, lingering on each finger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin pulled Sieg’s hand back towards him, placing it on his own chest so that Sieg could feel the thrum of his heart. When he then lifted it to kiss, it was only a coincidence that it was messy with both of their cum, and that he kissed the flat of Sieg’s palm to taste it. Sieg laughed at him— how nice it was to make him laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You forgot the chocolate,” Martin accused gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I figured you’d want to share the rest with other people,” Sieg replied. This might have been true, or it might have been a lie— the chocolate could have been accidentally abandoned in the heat of the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s true,” Martin said. “In the morning— that’s what we can do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In the morning,” Sieg repeated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He disentangled his legs from Sieg’s waist, but he carefully didn’t get up, and instead laid down on the thin bed, trying to leave as much room for Sieg as possible. There wasn’t much, but that didn’t matter. Sieg laid down, half on top of him, half next to him; it was all that the small bed allowed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was likely that Sieg would try to stay awake for as long as he could. That was the kind of person that he was. But Martin rubbed his thumb across the back of Sieg’s hand and murmured, “You should get some sleep. We’ll deal with trouble in the morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were out of time: the morning was only four hours away.</span>
