<h2 class="heading">An Obituary for Dietrich Bronner, As Published In the Neue Reich Daily Register</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>A friend of mine once told me that the only poem she thought she could write about grief would be a nearly blank page. A name at the top, and then all that white space beneath, like a headstone, or a funeral shroud. The felt absence made visible there on the paper. I think this is the best poem that you can write about grief, but I’m not a poet, and I have never been able to bear an empty space— all my life I’ve been obligated to fill them. It’s a useless endeavor, but what else can I do? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich Bronner used to tell me to stop and consider my words before I wrote them down. He’d mark huge scratches of red ink across whatever I gave him to look at: “Next time, Rome, before you hand me anything, cut its length in half. You already know what I’m going to tell you to do, so don’t make me say it. I don’t love to hear myself talk enough to want to repeat myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His philosophy was that an artist’s job was to distill life down to its most essential elements, and maybe not even that much: to leave things to implication and to trust that the audience would find themselves in those empty spaces that the art left behind. That was his gift as an artist, and as a person. I was drawn to him because he always said just enough to make the listener feel understood. He gave the impression that he understood everything, and he hated to ever drop the ruse, let anyone know that he was just a man like the rest of us.</span>
</p><p>
<span>I can’t decide if he’d think dying is a kind of weakness that way, or if he’d see it as finally gaining an invulnerable mythological status, perfected by memory and time. I should have asked him, but I doubt he would have answered. His art would outlive him, and that’s all that he would say mattered. Perhaps he would hope that the memory of him as a man would be lost completely, that only those things of his that approached perfection would remain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>I think that was why he left the world of the theater in the second half of his career, and started fresh in filmmaking. A play is an ephemeral thing, with life breathed into it only while the actors are on the stage. The audience may remember, or they may forget, but the moment will be over as the final bows conclude. A film can be played over and over, fixed and unchanging.</span>
</p><p>
<span>I met Dietrich in that strange moment in his life: when he was in the throes of the transition between stage and screen. He had taken a year to work as an artist in residence on Phezzan, teaching a graduate seminar class that I weaseled my way into without any right. I was an engineering undergraduate, age twenty, and the class was on playwriting. Other people would have killed to get one of the seats, but I managed to waltz in without much effort, aside from cornering him before the first class and asking him to sign the requisite paperwork. Up to that point in my life, I had never written anything worth mentioning, and it would be a lie to say that his class sparked some creative brilliance within me. The one act play I turned in at the end of the semester was a mountain of overambition that failed to materialize into anything coherent, a disaster unfit to see the light of day, let alone a stage. But nevertheless, and I don’t know how, I think Dietrich saw in me something of a kindred spirit, and he let me know that I should be free to continue a personal correspondence with him when he returned to Heinessen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>I did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>I won’t mention what we said to each other during those letters, a decade’s worth, and I’ll speak even less of what we said to each other in person, in the few happy occasions we’ve had to meet in the intervening years. His estate has sealed his correspondence, to be released a hundred years from now. That’s for my sake, and others, if no longer for his. I have half a mind to release what of his I have anyway, but he would have despised me for doing that. It surprises me that he didn’t have all his remaining unpublished material destroyed for good— but he always was a man who loved a surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich was a complicated man, and difficult to know, and it was one of the greatest blessings of my life to be one of the few people who did know him for our short walk together in this universe. You might have read his recent review of my latest work in the </span>
<em>
<span>Heinessen Register</span>
</em>
<span>, in which he (perhaps rightly) savaged parts of it— he was angry with me, I’m sure, though his criticism is fair enough regardless. He was a professional first, and everything else second. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s one thing for me to imagine myself lifting the curtain, revealing the small fears and loves of the men of the past, but it is quite another to do that to the living. I understand. And I’m sure that he, too, understood that I did it out of love, because I wanted other people to know him the way I knew him, to see him the way I’ve seen him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>I’ve heard it said that if you know someone completely, there’s no way you can escape loving them— no way you can hide from it. My mother would say that this is the way that God loves us (painfully), and Dietrich would say that I love playing God when I write.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Somehow, without my being able to do anything about it, he’s stopped being a living man who can scold me for loving him, and he’s become one of those men of the past— someone who can no longer speak to me, nor hear me shouting. I wish I had been able to talk with him sometime in the past few weeks, but I was unsure if he wanted me to, and, furthermore, what could I say that he didn’t already know?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich once told me that every story only has one way it can end, and unless you’re marching towards that inevitable conclusion, you’re not being true to the work. He always knew how the story ended, and God, I wish that he could tell me how it does. I wish he could have lived to see it, and told me if I was being true to the work, and to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He wouldn’t have told me, even if I had begged for it, so I’m already wishing for things from the dead that I would have never expected from the living. It’s strange, how that happens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Who was Dietrich Bronner? He was someone I looked up to immensely, someone whose shadow I often felt overwhelmed by, someone whose work eclipsed his self almost completely. It was impossible to know him as anything else. But despite that, he was my mentor, and my friend, and a man whom I deeply, deeply loved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich Bronner is dead, and all that’s left is the empty page, the unfinished work, the eulogy, the tombstone. But that’s always the way the story ends— he always knew that, and, maybe, so did I.</span>

<p>
<span>Dietrich Bronner was familiar with the office: it was his office, at home. The walls were dark wood and covered with bookcases where there was room, but the gloomy effect of the furniture was softened by the windows, which were thrown open into a courtyard garden. They let in some semblance of fresh summer air, even if there wasn't enough breeze to ripple the curtains. It was strangely quiet in the room. Usually, the city noises of Heinessenpolis were distantly audible over the high walls and chirping of birds in the garden, but today there was neither sound of birds nor city noise— just a stranger, dressed in a costume from hundreds of years ago, sitting at Dietrich's desk and holding in front of his face the plastic skull that had featured in his high school production of </span>
<em>
<span>Hamlet</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio," the man at the desk said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Poor delivery. Too affected," Dietrich snapped immediately. “You sound like a student.” He should have asked how the stranger had gotten in, but he had instincts stronger than self-preservation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps." He turned the skull around so that the empty eye sockets faced Dietrich, then put it down on the desk. “I was a student when I last played the part.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich recognized the man, in the way that one recognizes one’s own reflection, though the man at the desk was some twenty years younger than himself. “Rear Admiral Bronner,” he said, the knowledge coming to him without him having to search for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bronner clapped. “Good job. Now say the next line.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m dead,” Dietrich said. “Is that what this is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The knowledge should have felt heavier to bear, but it wasn’t as difficult as he had expected. It settled naturally into his brain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did I die of?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something that only kills men who live alone, these days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pity,” Dietrich said. He walked over to the window and looked out at the garden. “You’re not real. Did Rome have you say that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course. And your part, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich barked out a short laugh. “Where’s the script? He should have given me time to read my lines over before we both walked on stage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right here,” Bronner said. He reached into one of the drawers of Dietrich’s desk and pulled out the rather worn review copy of Nat Rome’s latest work, the scarlet cover marred with creases and the pages littered with post-it flags. When Bronner dropped it on the table with a heavy thump, Dietrich turned around and his lips pinched. He looked back out the window before he said anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Put that thing away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why should I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a tale told by an idiot,” Dietrich said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure he would agree.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich scoffed. “He’s the one putting that line in my mouth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> “What kind of stupid game is this?” Dietrich asked, turning around and walking over to the desk. Bronner didn’t move, and he picked up the plastic skull and looked at it, turning it over in his hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy,” Bronner said, and this time his delivery was much quieter. “He hath borne me on his back a thousand times. Here hung those lips that I have kiss’d I know not how oft.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You skipped two lines,” Dietrich said. “Start from the top.” But there wasn’t any venom in his comment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Artistic license,” Bronner replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rome doesn’t find me ‘abhorred in his imagination,’ is it?” Dietrich asked. There was a mirror above the fireplace on the other side of the room. That was usually where the skull lived, and Dietrich put the skull back where it had come from. He turned its grinning face towards the glass and looked at his own image next to the cheap prop. There was no luster of youth left, and his once thick hair had thinned to almost nothing. “I would.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Quiet,” Bronner said. “You’re not one now to mock your own grinning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich snorted and turned back around to Bronner, who was leaning forward on the desk, elbows on the polished wood. “You should take the opportunity to do so for me,” he said, and gestured to himself. “Memento mori.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I doubt I’ll get old,” Bronner said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think Rome will kill you off?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course— I think I’ll have outlasted my narrative usefulness sooner or later, and it will be convenient for someone to kill me. Oberstein, maybe. Rome has plenty of options. The next books will have endless opportunities.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have to keep playing the role for the story that he gave you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no— don’t you see how interesting it would be, to have an event that would break the narrative structure he’s been setting up? To remove the string tying it to history, and the way it is a story?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Dietrich said flatly. “I would hope that I have instilled in Rome at least the desire to write a coherent fiction. He won’t break the narrative enough to render it unrecognizable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He still might want to remove one of Yang Wenli’s allies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He won’t kill you,” Dietrich said, and when he said it, he felt very weary. He walked to the window again and leaned on the sill. The air of the garden stirred at last, rustling the leaves of the grand old oak tree and picking up wisps of Dietrich’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s too sentimental,” Dietrich said. “He might kill off anyone else— even the ones he likes most— but he won’t touch you. You’ll live.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And will he ruin the story to keep me alive?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Count yourself lucky that you have a bit part,” Dietrich said. “You’re small enough that his indulgences won’t matter.” He looked at the light as it rippled on the cobblestones where it passed through the greenery above. “Won’t matter to the world at all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’d want it to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t mean it does,” Dietrich said. He looked back at Bronner, an ironic glance. “He might have killed you off if I hadn’t died. You’re lucky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And how would you have felt about that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How am I supposed to know?” Dietrich asked. “Don’t ask me that question.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course. Rome is speaking through you. He couldn’t give himself that kind of reassurance.” Bronner’s smile was cruel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that what he wants here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He wants you to tell him how the story ends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If it was a story I wanted to write, I would have written it myself. I’ve told him that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich stared up into the sun, squinting at its perfect circle of brilliance, fixing his eyes on it like a stage light. It burned a hole in his vision, but he was dead, so what did it matter?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He doesn’t need artistic reassurance,” Dietrich said. “He might say he wants that, but he wants something else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To say goodbye.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not. That’s why he’s not here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s here— we’re not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the difference to me?” Bronner asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s no difference to anyone. I said it wouldn’t matter to the world at all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich came over to the desk and picked up the worn copy of the book. He flipped through it, not landing on any page in particular, just feeling the paper move beneath his hands like a deck of cards. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You won’t make me say goodbye, Rome?” he asked the air. “Put it in the script. I’d have to say it then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Give a bow, then,” Bronner said. “Walk offstage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dietrich looked at Bronner— his eyes were amused— and nodded. That, at least, was something he could do. He stepped away from the desk, towards the door, but he tucked the book beneath his arm. With his hand on the door handle he began to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,</span>
</p><p>
<span>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,</span>
</p><p>
<span>To the last syllable of recorded time;</span>
</p><p>
<span>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</span>
</p><p>
<span>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player,</span>
</p><p>
<span>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then is heard no more. It is a tale</span>
</p><p>
<span>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</span>
</p><p>
<span>Signifying nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he finished, he nodded at Bronner, gave a deep bow to the empty center of the room, and left, shutting the door gently behind himself. </span>

<p>
<span>Tobias was coughing again in the bunk above Martin’s. The thin metal-framed structure of the bunk bed wasn’t fastened to the walls, and there were just the thick nylon straps woven to hold a person’s weight between the two of them, so with every violent hack out of his lungs, the whole structure swayed and creaked. Tobias’s illness kept half their room awake, and while the poor man tried to stifle the noise, there wasn’t much he could do. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin had found him crying in the outhouse the day before, bloody spittle on his lips and his eyes bulging and red in his face from the force of his coughing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re all just hoping I’ll die so you can get some sleep,” Tobias sobbed, at least as much as he could heave breath in to sob with.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin told him that it wasn’t true, but it probably was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight, there was no chance that Martin would fall asleep, at least not until Tobias had finally exhausted himself enough to pass out, so Martin pulled himself off his bunk, wrapped his blanket around his shoulders, and headed outside. He was already wearing his shoes and coat— it was too cold to take them off, even to sleep. The blanket, he pulled over his head, clasping the front of it shut with his hands as much as he was able. His hat had gone missing a few days ago and he hadn’t yet found another, so his blanket would have to do. At the door, he slipped his feet into one of the pairs of homemade “snowshoes” made of stacked cardboard, with a loop to hold them over the top of his shoes. They made trooping across the calf-high snow a lot easier— especially considering how little he weighed. He swayed on his feet, feeling faint and tired but determined to go out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was nearly suicidal to go outside, but that didn’t stop people from doing it. It wasn’t forbidden— there were no locks on the doors, and no guards patrolling their huts. It didn’t matter to the soldiers if the prisoners wandered off to die in the snow, which anyone would if they strayed too far from safety. Even though their dormitory shacks were barely heated, they at least provided sufficient protection from the wind, which cut across Martin’s face the moment he stepped outside the door. It wasn’t snowing directly, but the wind picked up flakes from the ground and swept them along in river-like streams, illuminated by the planet’s single, huge moon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was one thing Martin liked about this place. Odin’s moon wasn’t nearly so large. This one was bright enough to read by, even when it was only a quarter-full. One of the men who had been in the camp when Martin arrived had explained some of the physics of it to him, the way it had gotten tidally locked to this planet billions of years ago, and the way that this place’s gravity was slowly stretching it out, elongating it from a sphere into an ellipsoid. It was funny, the things that Martin remembered— he couldn’t recall the man’s face, nor did he think that he had ever learned his name to begin with. But he thought about his warm voice coming out of chapped lips and the shape of the moon every time he looked up at the sky. To think that the flat white cutout in the night had a hidden depth to it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even if it was cold outside, it was at least quiet, and the snowscape studded with their sleeping quarters had a pristine kind of beauty to it. Off in the distance was the entrance to the mine— that was guarded, unlike their huts— and further off was the processing plant. Martin’s eyes skated over them, and he turned in the other direction, intending to walk just a little ways away, over the crest of the next hill, so that he didn’t see any of the buildings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As he climbed the hill, he noticed another figure down the slope, not even wearing a jacket. This was not the first time Martin had intercepted someone out here like this, and it probably wouldn’t be the last. He had a tactic for it— he’d tell the guy that if he was set on dying out here, could Martin please have his shirt and pants and shoes and socks and underwear? Otherwise they’d go to waste, get lost in the snow. Most people couldn’t bear to strip down to nothing, and so he had an excuse to get them back inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin was mentally preparing his speech as he slid down the side of the hill. He wasn’t entirely sure that he was doing anybody any favors by convincing them to live— prolonging their lives for perhaps a year or two at the most— but he couldn’t stand the thought of leaving someone by himself. If he ever met someone he couldn’t convince to go back in, he wondered if he’d end up staying outside with him all night. He wondered if he wasn’t secretly hoping that would happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not gonna let you freeze to death out here,” Martin said to the man, who hadn’t noticed him coming— he was looking up at the moon, and the soft sounds of Martin’s snowshoes were easily covered by the wind. Martin held out his blanket as the man jumped and turned around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin was startled, but it was the kind of surprise that one might feel in a dream, that made him aware that it was a dream, that he must be back in his bunk asleep beneath Tobias coughing himself to death. The man stared back at him with his own face— cheeks a little fuller, lips less blistered with the icy wind, the hollows of his eyes less pronounced, but his face nonetheless. He had almost forgotten what it looked like.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not cold,” the other Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take it anyway.” He held out the blanket until the visitor accepted it, wrapping it around his shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is this place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Altair. For political prisoners.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The visitor’s brow furrowed— it was funny to see his own familiar expressions on someone else’s face— searching for where he had heard the name before. He had heard it. “Not where Liesel ended up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was a name Martin hadn’t heard in a long time— the idealistic young woman who had been his friend in high school, had taken him under his wing, until the community house where she and other anarchists had been staying was raided. “No, women aren’t sent here— I think she went to Fomalhaut.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.” The other Martin looked up in the sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fomalhaut is that one—” he said, pointing to a dim star off in the distance. The night was completely unclouded, but the moon was so bright it crowded the smaller lights out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is she alive, do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I doubt it.” Martin’s finger traced across the sky. “I was told Odin was that direction. But that’s Sol— Earth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you do a lot of stargazing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What else is there to do in the abyss?” Martin asked. He had pity on his visiting other self, giving him the missing information, the name that had been on the tip of his tongue. “Altair is where Arle Heinessen escaped from.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah,” the visitor said. He looked up at the sky. “He probably did a lot of stargazing, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The visitor seemed to search for words. “Will you escape?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I doubt it,” Martin said. “I probably have six months to live, give or take. Less, if I get sick. Nobody lasts long here.” He glanced at his other self, and he said it without rancor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t know how he could be so calm now. Maybe it was the grace that dreams gave sometimes, or perhaps he just wanted to comfort his visitor. It was very different from every shift he had at the mine, standing in line at lunch to receive the meager bowl of food that they were each given once a day. Then, he fantasized about snatching the guns from the guards, taking the planet’s leader hostage, demanding the ships come down from orbit, and commandeering them. He even talked about it sometimes, with a few of the others. But the visitor already seemed unbearably sad— though perhaps this was a projection, a remnant of Martin thinking he had come out here to die— so he didn’t mention his thoughts, since mentioning his thoughts would have meant dwelling on the frustration of futility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it worse to be here— knowing that someone did escape once?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The question surprised him, and Martin thought about it for a moment. “No, not really.” He fixed the moon in his vision. “No— I don’t mind the hope.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hundreds of years of people trapped in this place,” the visitor said, probably doing the mental math. There were maybe three thousand prisoners in this camp right now— if the whole population of the camp was swept out and replaced every ten years (Martin had never heard anyone living longer than that— and most didn’t make it nearly that long), that was well over a million people who had passed through the snow since Heinessen’s time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like to think—” Martin said. “I like to think that he remembered everyone he was leaving behind when he got out. Even us— who hadn’t arrived yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know if remembering the nameless millions means anything,” the visitor said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin looked at him. “I always thought it did. If you’re going to do anything more than look out for yourself— you should know who you’re doing it for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right. It matters for everyone except the nameless millions.” He shivered, then shook himself and wrapped the blanket tightly around his shoulders. “Sorry,” he said. “I’m being grim. Sieg would tell me to—” He looked at Martin suddenly, as if realizing something. “He’s dead for you, isn’t he? This is— I’m knowing the alternative, if I lived. If he died for me.” Something broke in his throat, and Martin took a step forward and put his hand on the visitor’s arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey— no— it’s alright. Who’s Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This stupefied the visitor. “Who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Martin Bufholtz,” he said. “And you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Martin Bufholtz,” the visitor replied. “But you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s Sieg?” Martin asked again. “Tell me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Siegfried Kircheis, he—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! Yes, I know him,” Martin said. “It’s funny— I was thinking about him the other day. I ran into him a few months before I was sent here—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s alive? He’s free?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin shrugged. “Unless he’s been killed in the fleet. But he’s the type to survive, it seems like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The visitor let out a breath of relief and smiled. “Good. That’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You must have known him better than I did,” Martin said. “Except for that day last summer, I hadn’t seen him since we were both kids, after he ran off with that transfer student— Reinhard von Musel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This seemed to confuse the visitor even further. “He went to the Alliance?” he asked. “With Musel?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Martin said. “They both left school to join a military academy.” Martin looked at the visitor sidelong. “Funny thought, Musel in the Alliance. He’s a rear admiral in the Imperial Fleet, I think. Wonder what he’s doing over there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He worked at the embassy on Phezzan,” the visitor said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah.” This clearly wasn’t a topic that the visitor cared about, so Martin changed the subject. “But Siegfried Kircheis…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He is— was— is—” The tenderness in the visitor’s voice expressed everything that Martin needed to know. Picturing </span>
<em>
<span>himself</span>
</em>
<span> with the stupidly tall redhead was a funny thought— one that would probably entertain him significantly during his shift in the mines tomorrow— but he didn’t let the amusement onto his face. “We only really got to know each other after Christopher died.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Martin said. “That’s a long time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah.” Perhaps the visitor had been hoping to hear that Christopher was alive as well, but he wasn’t. He looked off into the distance. “It’s a long story.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you cold?” the visitor asked. “We’re standing out in the snow. And I took your blanket.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Martin said, and found that although he would have said that as a lie, he realized after saying it that it was true. For the first time in months, he wasn’t cold. “I think I’m dreaming. We have time. The sun doesn’t rise for another fourteen hours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s walk,” the visitor said. He didn’t seem to mind shuffling deep through the snow, and he began climbing the hill. Martin had an easier time with his snow shoes, but neither of them walked quickly. Martin pointed out the few features of the moonlit landscape, and the visitor told his story.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a long one, though it proceeded in a single, clear line from beginning to end, this visitor seizing the single chance he saw to change the world. The story was full of characters, some familiar to Martin and some strangers, and it seemed to delight the visitor whenever Martin remarked on who of his old set remained alive. When Martin heard a name of someone who was dead, he made no mention at all. The visitor understood what his silence meant. Perhaps he should have lied, told him that they were all alive, that he was the only one who had ever been sent to this frozen hell, that everyone else had escaped— but he couldn’t bring himself to do that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To Martin, the tale the visitor told seemed like something out of a dream. He couldn’t easily imagine himself charging through the palace, wielding a gun, trying to take the government by force. Or, he could imagine it clearly, but it was as distant from reality as the idle dream he had about taking hostages and escaping here. He studied the visitor as he spoke, trying to pick out what the essential difference between the two of them was. Perhaps there was no essential difference. This was simply a dream, his subconscious trying to cajole him into taking action— though even his subconscious assumed he would die doing so. Maybe he wanted to be told that anything was better than dying in the snow, or starving to death. But he accepted the dream-logic for what it was, and accepted the visitor’s story as true. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The tale ended in Neue Sanssouci. The visitor said that Siegfried was in position to take the Kaiserin hostage and escape, but even at his most optimistic, the visitor was realistic. “There’s a chance he made it out,” the visitor said, allowing Siegfried only a chance. “He’s not here— with me, at least. And I’m dead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He might have gotten out.” Martin looked off into the sky. “I don’t know. Like I said, none of that has happened here, so he’s still alive— and he seems like a survivor.” He kicked at the snow. “The Kaiser’s still alive, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The visitor seemed startled by that. “What year is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“486,” Martin said. “April.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh— it was 489.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re older than I am,” Martin said. And this time, he couldn’t get the bitterness out of his voice. “Lucky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll outlive me,” the visitor said. He sounded like he was asking Martin to promise to do so, which was something that Martin neither could nor would do. He changed the subject.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s still funny to think of Siegfried as a revolutionary,” Martin said. “When I spoke to him—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s not much to say. He was visiting his parents back home for Whitsummer, and I ran into him at the fair. We ate some fried dough together in the park—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that horrible statue still there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is.” Martin laughed a little. “It seems like if Musel gets his way, it’ll be gone. He all but said that he wanted to tear down the old order.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will he?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. And I can’t really say what Musel would put in its place either.” He kicked some snow that had formed into a little peak, sent it scurrying down the hill away from them. “He’s a military man to the core.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sieg’s not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No— there was still something human in him.” He might have been unfair to Siegfried Kircheis, but the visitor seemed to understand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There still are things he’d rather see than a fleet of ships.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Martin said. It had been a long time since he had heard any poetry— the half-quoted line warmed him. “It’s funny— he might be the only one who remembers me out there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I gave him my thesis to read— I hadn’t finished it yet. I still haven’t finished it.” It was funny, the things that one came to regret in this place. “Maybe he’ll think of me sometimes, here in the pit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I made him read mine over, too,” the visitor said. “Gods—” He seemed right on the edge of tears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did he like it? I never got to hear what he thought of my draft.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, he did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They had come up to the mine, and Martin again knew that this was a dream, because the guards who usually stood at the front were missing. Aside from the guard housing, the mine and the processing plant were the only places that had any machinery or food, and thee things were kept strictly away from the prisoners, and strictly guarded. Martin was tempted to lead the visitor towards the dream-kitchen, but he had the sneaking suspicion that any food he got his hands on would vanish before he got it to his mouth— that was the way of dreams. Instead, he asked, “Do you want to see something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He pulled open the rattling fence gate of the mine, and then turned the crank on the heavy metal door to go inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your ears will pop when we go down,” he said, leading the visitor towards the elevator shaft. “But we don’t have to go all the way down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator itself was open-walled, a metal frame covered by thin fence-grate that was as light as they could make it, to carry as many men as they could fit. Sometimes fifty men would be crammed in there. It often broke— Martin had been trapped in it for more than an hour, once. To be in it empty, with just himself and the visitor, was a very strange experience. He rattled the chain door shut, then flipped open the control panel that would send them downwards. The whole thing moved with a clank and a shiver, sending them down into the depths. The visitor, standing directly in the scratched floor, shook and closed his eyes, clenching his fists. Only the single bare bulb on the ceiling, which flickered as the elevator descended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, look,” Martin said. He stopped holding the descent button, and the elevator ground to a halt in the middle of the shaft, though the floor bounced slightly when he walked across it. He pulled on the visitor’s arm, and led him to the fence-wire wall. Their shadows almost obscured what was there, but when Martin shifted to let the light fall on the wall, the visitor could see it. He reached out a single finger to touch it, his hand coming away grimy with rock dust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All through the shaft, scratched with the fine points of mining tools into the smoothed stone, were names. Martin had noticed them his first descent down, and on his miserable way back up from the end of his first shift down in the mines, the prisoner holding the button had stopped the elevator car just long enough to let him carve a clumsy MARTIN BUFHOLTZ into the stone. He had long since forgotten where it was, how deep in the shaft, or even what side of the elevator car it had been in. All he knew, and all that mattered, was that it was there. If the names had been scratched anywhere else, the guards might have had the writing removed, to get rid of any sign of rebellion or personhood, but it was far too costly to do that kind of work in the elevator shaft, so the names survived.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is Heinessen’s name here?” the visitor asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Martin said. “I don’t know how long this shaft’s been in use. Probably not— you can’t mine the same spot for a couple hundred years.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, too bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some other wall, probably. I’m sure he left one— everybody’s always trying to make their mark. Not be forgotten down here.” He leaned against the side wall, looked over at the visitor. “Will someone remember you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If Sieg lived—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And if he didn’t?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No— I’m sure they won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here,” Martin said. He fished in the pocket of his jacket, pulled out his favorite possession in this place— a fork he had stolen from the guards. He kept it on him at all times, since someone would take it from him if he didn’t, and eating their meager lunches with it made him feel more human. The stone was just soft enough that almost any metal could scratch it, even a blunt piece of stainless steel. “Go ahead. Join our nameless millions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your name’s already here, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin shrugged. The visitor looked at the wall, dragged his fingers across it until he found a blank space. Instead of carving his name, he painstakingly scratched a line of poetry,  something none of the men in the elevator had enough time to do. It was a single fragment where all the surrounding lines had been lost. As he did, he spoke. He was addressing Martin, but his words were clearly a comfort only for him. “If it’s only 486, just wait for the Kaiser to die,” he said. “Sieg will remember you— he’ll get you out of here. You and everybody else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll try,” Martin said, though he knew in his heart it was unlikely to happen. He lay his hand on the visitor’s, his bony fingers overlapping the other’s. “Shall we go back up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The visitor shivered again. “Yes— I won’t keep you down here with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martin shook his head. But he went over to the control panel, and they started their ascent. It was a dream, and time had passed strangely. When Martin opened the door at the top, he was blinded by the light of day, glinting off the snow.</span>
