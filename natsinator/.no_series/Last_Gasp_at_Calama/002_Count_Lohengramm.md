# Count Lohengramm

Ostensibly, Reinhard and Kircheis had been invited to Baroness Magdalena von Westpfale’s house to have dinner and celebrate Kircheis’s promotion to captain, but the force with which Magdalena had extended the invitation made Reinhard sure that this was not just a social visit. Nothing was ever *just* a social visit with Magdalena, though she would protest that statement, if Reinhard chose to say it aloud.

She had dressed up for the occasion, her dress shiny and black to match her hair, and the neckline almost dripped off her chest. She smiled impishly at Reinhard when he came in, and fluttered her fan in front of her face when she looked at Kircheis. 

Dinner itself was pleasant enough, which was what gave Reinhard a clue that Magdalena wanted to discuss something very serious after dinner. They could talk on at length about her visits to Reinhard’s sister, or Kircheis’s promotion, and Magdalena could be the world’s most charming hostess  while the servants were in the room, and nothing of substance could be spoken of. 

Reinhard sometimes thought that Magdalena understood operational security far better than some of the higher echelons of the fleet did.

After dinner, they moved into her library, with its dark furniture and walls of books that stretched up to the ceiling. Reinhard gave a mindless push to the ladder that circled the room on tracks to make the upper levels accessible, and it clattered away a few meters before coming to rest. Kircheis closed the door firmly behind them all, then stood awkwardly with his hands behind his back.

“Shall I get you something to drink?” Magdalena asked, flouncing over to the bar cart that had been set up. “Port, perhaps?”

“My sister would chastise you for trying to get me drunk,” Reinhard said. “You’ve trapped us both here to take advantage.”

Magdalena laughed. “I would like to, wouldn’t I? Is that a yes?”

“I suppose I shouldn’t say no to your hospitality.”

“And you, Sieg?”

“Yes, thank you, Baroness,” Kircheis said.

She handed glasses to both of them, and then linked her now free arm with Kircheis’s, dragging him to take a seat next to her on the couch. It was a funny sight: he was more than a head taller than she was, but she moved with such surety that Kircheis didn’t have time to protest, only sparing a pained glance at Reinhard, whose mouth puckered as he sat on the armchair across from them both.

“I suppose it’s Kircheis you’re taking most advantage of,” Reinhard said.

“He doesn’t mind. Do you, Sieg?”

Kircheis didn’t have a canned response to that, so he just smiled.

“What have you dragged us here to talk about, Baroness?” Reinhard asked. “We ought to be getting home-- I have a meeting with Fleet Admiral Muckenburger tomorrow, early.”

Magdalena’s voice was almost delighted as she answered, “Oh, you’ve just done the work of bringing up several things that I would like to talk to you about. Forewarned is forearmed.”

“I’m not sure what you have to say on the subject of Fleet Admiral Muckenburger or morning meetings,” Reinhard said. “You’re certainly not in the fleet, and I wasn’t aware that you knew him.”

“Darling,” Magdalena said, “for one thing: I know everyone. And for another, don’t you think I would look absolutely thrilling in one of your fleet uniforms?”

Reinhard took a sip of his port and said nothing.

“Sieg, agree with me that I would look good in uniform,” Magdalena demanded.

Kircheis scratched his head, flushing as red as his hair. “I don’t think they would really fit you, Baroness.”

“That would be no object.”

“Baroness--” Reinhard began.

“Oh, come on, *Count Lohengramm*. We’re in private now. It would kill no one for you both to call me Maggie. Gods know your sister does.”

“I am not my sister.”

“More’s the pity.” Magdalena smiled. She cocked her head at him, her loose black hair catching the yellow reflected lamplight and shimmering with it. “I am sorry that I couldn’t arrange to have her here.”

“I understand that my sister has constraints on her time,” Reinhard said, keeping the bitterness out of his voice. Of course, it was less that his sister was busy, and more that Reinhard was not allowed to see her, except with express permission of the Kaiser. Visiting her was his reward for victory in battle, these days. She was the leash that kept him tied to the Kaiser.

Magdalena had no such restrictions on visiting Annerose, as her friend, and so Reinhard did appreciate her willingness to act as a go-between, as well as her stories about how Annerose was doing and feeling.

“I’m sure you’ll get to see her soon,” Magdalena said, consoling and surprisingly genuine.

“Perhaps.” Reinhard put down his glass on the side table. “What was it that you wanted to tell me?”

“Three things,” she said. “But they are all wrapped up together, I’m afraid, so it won’t be easy to discuss any of them.”

“Let’s start with what you want me to know about Fleet Admiral Muckenburger.”

“You’re going to be sent out to do battle again, soon.”

“That’s hardly secret knowledge,” Reinhard said. “It’s a fact of life in His Majesty’s fleet.”

“You’re being schemed against.”

“Baroness-- Magdalena,” Kircheis said, interrupting. “We are aware that Lord Reinhard has enemies.”

“*We* are aware,” she repeated. “Here’s a question: how are your latest acquisitions to your little cadre of talent? Rear Admirals Reuenthal and Mittermeyer.”

Reinhard narrowed his eyes at her. “They are not part of your social circle,” he said. “I don’t know why you want to know.”

“Oh, Reuenthal didn’t tell you we had met?” She smirked at him. She was enjoying drawing out the suspense, but at least she sounded more amused than aggrieved about Reuenthal. He was a man with a bad reputation, but of all the women in the capital, Magdalena was probably closest to his match.

“Reuenthal’s personal life is none of my concern,” Reinhard said.

Magdalena leaned forward, seizing on that. “Oh, I think it’s quite a lot of your concern, actually.”

“What women he sees is no business of mine, even if you are among their number, Magdalena.”

She laughed. It was a charming sound-- the kind of laugh that made the listener know she had spent time practicing it in a mirror like an actress. It went on for just the right amount of time. Kircheis shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Let’s not pretend like we both don’t know what part of Reuenthal’s personal life I’m referring to. It has very little to do with women,” Magdalena said. 

“Explain whatever your pet theory is to me, then,” Reinhard demanded.

“Must I be crass?” she asked. She was enjoying herself too much.

“If that is what it takes for you to get to the point, yes.”

“You’re no fun.”

“You should have invited someone else to dinner if you wanted a houseguest who is entertaining at parties.”

She laughed again. “Is he this funny when you’re alone, Sieg?” she asked, turning to Kircheis.

“Funnier, Baroness,” Kircheis said. His tone was dry, but he cracked a little smile at last.

She leaned back on the couch, throwing her arms across the back of it. Reinhard kept a close eye on the hand that trailed near Kircheis’s back, but she didn’t touch him. She saw his look and she smiled, a smug, secretive expression as she met his eyes. “Now, Lord Reinhard, we both know that you loaned Reuenthal your aid, and your sister’s influence alongside it, because you have certain things in common.”

“I agreed to help him because he said that he and Mittermeyer could be useful to me. I believed him.”

“Come on, you don’t think I would judge you for being sentimental, do you?” Reinhard was silent, so she turned to Kircheis. “Sieg, did it tug the strings of your heart to see the high-and-mighty Reuenthal plead for help on behalf of-- well--”

“How do you know all of this?” Reinhard interrupted, cutting her off to rescue Kircheis. He was done with the game.

“He keeps a photo of Rear Admiral Mittermeyer on his bedside table,” Magdalena said curtly. “I wouldn’t have known if I hadn’t seen that.”

“And he let you see that?”

“No, I went snooping,” she said. “And then he kicked me out of his house.” Her tone changed to something a little less manufactured. “Actually, maybe don’t mention to him that I’m talking to you about this.”

“Why are you talking to me about this?”

“Because, Lord Reinhard, Herr von Reuenthal is capable of being discreet. But he came to you for help because you are not.”

Reinhard scowled and said nothing.

“You’re lucky that Reuenthal only was taking advantage of your sympathy,” Magdalena said. “But it’s only a matter of time before someone takes objection to your, shall we say, lifestyle.”

“Baroness,” Kircheis said, “I believe there are more pressing things that people object to about Lord Reinhard.”

She laughed and leaned her head on Kircheis’s shoulder. “Of course. But you and I both know that the Kaiser isn’t going to live much longer, and after that, you will lack certain protections.”

“I don’t need the Kaiser’s protection,” Reinhard said.

Magdalena sat up straight and crossed her arms. “Put your pride away for one second, and listen to what I’m telling you.”

“You’re not telling me anything.”

“Right now, the only way that people are allowed to try to kill you is by sending you into danger in the fleet. I don’t doubt that you’ll survive, gods know you’re good at what you do, but there are other ways that people can make your life miserable.”

“If you say so.”

“As I said, people are already scheming against you.”

“Do you have details, or is this a generalized warning? I don’t need the latter.”

“I have details,” she said. “When you go out at the end of the year, heading towards a battle that everyone thinks is unwinnable, you will not have any of your top staff with you.”

“Any?” Reinhard asked, his eyes widening, looking at Kircheis, who frowned.

“Aside from Captain Kircheis,” Magdalena said. “I’m sure it’s with the intent to kill the both of you.”

“Oh.” Reinhard relaxed, smiling, and waved his hand. “Reuenthal, Mittermeyer, and Captain Mecklinger can all enjoy their vacation, then.”

“I wouldn’t be quite so glib, if I were in your shoes, but I’m glad you think it’s no issue.”

“As long as no one causes trouble for them on Odin while I’m away, I don’t think it matters.”

“Probably no one will,” Magdalena said.

“And who arranged this?”

“Duke Braunschweig and Baron Flegel,” Magdalena said.

“Of course it was them.”

“I’d appreciate if you didn’t let anyone know I had given you this information.”

“I understand operational security as well as you do,” Reinhard said. “Though clearly Baron Flegel does not.”

“He doesn’t know how to keep his mouth shut,” Magdalena said derisively. “It’s not an attractive quality in friends, but it’s a useful one in enemies.”

“I appreciate the warning,” Reinhard said. “Was that all?”

“That wasn’t even what I wanted to talk to you about,” Magdalena said. “It was just to get your attention.”

“I’m listening,” Reinhard said. “If you’ll stop drawing out the suspense, that is. I really do have an early meeting.”

“You, of all people, don’t need beauty sleep,” Magdalena said with a huff. “But very well, I’ll be blunt, if that’s what you want.”

“It is.”

“I think you’ve gotten lucky,” Magdalena said, her tone quite serious now. “Flegel and his company have thought that it’s easier to kill you and Sieg together, and rid themselves of both problems at once. But, sooner or later, they are going to realize that a far more devastating blow would be to separate you from him, by one means or another.”

Reinhard met Kircheis’s eyes. “Kircheis is perfectly capable of protecting himself from the likes of Baron Flegel.”

“You’re not listening to me.”

Reinhard silently stared at Magdalena and waited for her to continue.

“What I mean is that it’s not just going to be Baron Flegel and his ilk, now that you’re really part of the court. Now that you have a title.”

“I don’t see how that changes things.”

“It does,” Magdalena said. “Before, they hated you because they hated your sister, for her position in the Kaiser’s life. Now that you have proven yourself in the Kaiser’s eyes, they are going to hate you on your own merits. And I’m not just talking about petty grudges with Flegel because you were rude to him at a party, or anything like that. You’re going to have the whole of the court against you if you don’t behave in ways that they like.”

“I’m not a dancing act. I don’t care what the court thinks.”

“Oh, I just can’t with you!”

“Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said. Reinhard looked sharply at him, and Kircheis’s small smile made him drop his defensiveness, at least a little. “Baroness Westpfale is right: it will be more difficult to protect your sister, and accomplish what we need to, if we have no allies in the court.”

“*Thank* you, Sieg. I’m not suggesting you become a slave to the fashion, as it were, but you need to think about the allies you can find outside the fleet. The fleet is all well and good, but it doesn’t run without money and support from the nobility.”

“And how do you expect me to change the court’s opinion?”

“You have to become one of them, I’m afraid. They hate status seekers, but they at least understand them. Someone like yourself who acts indifferent to status is like an invading germ-- the court’s immune system will drive you out.”

Reinhard frowned. “And what changes do you expect me to make?”

“Let’s start with the easiest. Number one, you must start signing your personal correspondence as *Count* Lohengramm, rather than *Admiral* Lohengramm.”

“Isn’t the name enough?” Reinhard asked. “Not that I had any attachment to ‘Müsel’, but one would think that taking a distinguished name would satisfy people.”

“No,” Magdalena said flatly. “There’s a reason that generally only younger sons go into the fleet: it’s a far lower tier of respectability, but if one doesn’t inherit, it’s the only title one can hope to earn.”

“The fleet is the great equalizer of classes, is it?” Reinhard said, voice dry.

Magdalena laughed. “You know that is not the case. But this is an easy concession to make. Just start making it.”

“If you insist. What else do you want me to change about my *lifestyle*?”

Magdalena smiled and leaned forward to pick up a pad of paper and pen sitting on the coffee table between them. As she scribbled something in her elegant but carefree hand, she said, “You haven’t just inherited a title: you have an estate, as well. Even if you won’t manage it directly, you can’t let it and the money languish. This is my lawyer. He will be expecting a call from you, and he can explain to you exactly what needs to be done to manage your property. If you do not call him, I will be very displeased.” She ripped off the top sheet of paper, and handed it to Reinhard. He glanced at the name-- Matthew von Crawley, then folded the paper and tucked it into his breast pocket.

“Fine,” he said. “I’ll speak with him.”

“And on the subject of your estate, one part of it is a lovely home in the capital.” She paused, waiting expectantly.

“So?”

“You need to move out of Linbergestrasse. It doesn’t make sense for a count to be a tenant in someone’s rented flat.”

“That will be a pain,” Reinhard said. “Kircheis--”

“You will need to move there without Kircheis,” Magdalena said. “You can’t keep living together.”

“No,” Reinhard snapped. “I shall not. We’ve lived together for almost a decade, and I see no reason for that to change.”

“It was different when you were not a count,” Magdalena said. “A schoolboy or a soldier can have a roommate. It makes sense to split rent money when you do not have money. But a count cannot.”

“No.”

“I’m not asking you to never see each other,” Magdalena said. “I’m asking you to bee a little more circumspect. That’s all.”

“I don’t care what you’re asking. I will either move into the new house with Kircheis, or I will remain at Linbergstrasse.”

She sighed. “Think about it, anyway.”

Magdalena had spoiled any good mood that Reinhard had. “Was there any other part of my life you wanted to upend? Are you going to tell me to resign my commission and retire from the fleet, next?”

She looked at him with a surprisingly sympathetic expression, but this only made Reinhard frown further.

“I’m going to get you invited around to places,” she said. When Reinhard opened his mouth to protest, she held up her hand to forestall him. “I don’t care if you do not like the court. You need to become familiar with it. You will make your rounds,” she said. “For Annerose’s sake, if not your own.”

Reinhard stood, which caused Kircheis to stand, as well. “If that is *all*, Baroness.”

“Think about what I said, Lord Reinhard,” Magdalena said. “This is my world, and I know how to navigate it.”

“I will think about it,” he said, very grudgingly. “Goodnight, Baroness.”

Magdalena stood, looked at him for a second, and then embraced him. “Goodnight, Lord Reinhard.” She turned to Kircheis. “And goodnight to you, as well, Sieg.”

“Thank you for the lovely dinner, Baroness,” Kircheis said.

She laughed. “I’ll tell my cook that you enjoyed it.”

 

 

Their rented flat on Linbergstrasse was quiet and cozy, with the fire low in the hearth. Their landladies were well asleep by the time that Reinhard and Kircheis returned, sneaking up the stairs back into their own domain.

“Honestly, I do not know what my sister sees in that woman,” Reinhard said as he divested himself of his jacket. “She does not know how to stay out of other people’s business.”

“That can be a helpful thing to have in a friend, Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said, pulling off his own cravate. “She means well.”

“Don’t tell me she’s convinced you to move out of here,” Reinhard said, scowling.

“I don’t believe she intended that I move. Only you.”

Reinhard turned away, stalking towards the windows. “I don’t care what the court thinks of me. If they hate me, all the better.”

“You should ask Lady Annerose about it, next time you see her.”

“What good will that do?”

“If she believes that Baroness Westpfale is correct, I think we could put up with the inconvenience of living apart, for a little while, at least.”

Reinhard’s scowl softened when he saw Kircheis come up behind him, in the warped reflection in the windowpane. “Until we take the universe?” he asked.

“Until you have enough power that no one can touch you,” Kircheis said. “Then we won’t have to care what other people think.”

“I don’t care.”

“I know.”

“Do you?”

“Not in that way,” Kircheis said. “But Lady Annerose would appreciate me thinking about how to keep you safe-- from the court as well as the rebel fleet.”

“It’s stooping to their level,” Reinhard said. “To bow and play the game by their rules.”

“It won’t be their rules for much longer, Lord Reinhard.”

Reinhard smiled. “No, I don’t believe it will be.”

“Will you go see that lawyer about the estate?”

“I should, shouldn’t I? I’ll give him a call tomorrow, see if he can fit me in.”

“If Baroness Westpfale told him to expect you, I’m sure he can.”

“True.” Reinhard stared out the window at the dark garden below. “You don’t want to leave me, do you, Kircheis?”

Kircheis’s answer was to wrap his arms around Reinhard, bury his nose in Reinhard’s sun-bright hair. “You should get to bed. You’ll be in a terrible mood if you don’t sleep well before you see Muckenburger.”

Reinhard turned, difficult still enclosed in Kircheis’s arms. “Damn Muckenburger,” he said.

Kircheis smiled, his eyes crinkling shut, and Reinhard tugged on his curly red hair, bringing his head down so that they could kiss, his back against the window.

 

 

A few days later, Reinhard met the lawyer that Magdalena had recommended in his office. It was a well kept place, bustling with activity, and the receptionist was very obsequious to Reinhard when he arrived at the door in his uniform, saying he had an appointment.

The lawyer who came out to meet him was stocky man about Reinhard’s height, with a gregarious, round face underneath light brown, swept back hair. He extended a hand to Reinhard to shake. “Admiral Lohengramm, it’s an honor to meet you.”

“Since it was Baroness Westpfale who recommended me your services, and I’m not here on fleet business, I’d have thought everyone would insist on calling me ‘Count,’ Herr Crawley.”

“Old habits die hard,” Matthew said. “I feel like I would be chewed out by my CO to address him by anything other than his rank, even if we were to meet on the street these days. Right this way, sir.” He led Reinhard into his office, which was brightly lit and comfortably full of books and other paraphernalia of the lawyer’s trade. They both sat across from each other, with Matthew’s heavy wooden desk between them. Reinhard felt unexpectedly out of his element.

“You were in the fleet?” he asked, by way of orienting himself.

“I served on a ship called the *Blue Danube*,” he said. “Only ever went as far as lieutenant, but that was plenty for me. I don’t think it would have suited anybody assigned under me if I had advanced further-- it wasn’t really my strong suit.”

Reinhard nodded. “Some people never recognize that about themselves. It does you credit.”

“I almost didn’t-- I might have stayed in if my mother hadn’t begged me to come home after my tour was up,” he said. “You know how mothers are.”

“I’m afraid mine died when I was very young,” Reinhard said.

Matthew blanched. “My condolences, sir.”

Reinhard waved his hand. “I hardly remember her. My sister practically raised me.” To spare Matthew from further embarrassment, he said, “I haven’t had to deal with this inheritance business before. When my father died, there was nothing left, so I’m glad to have someone recommended to walk me through it.”

“Certainly, sir,” Matthew said. 

“Do you know the Baroness Westpfale well?”

“A purely business relationship,” he said. “My firm had served her father, the Baron Westpfale, and he died just as Herr Fellenburg was retiring. I was very pleased when the baroness asked me to overlook her estate.”

“Any particular reason she chose you?”

“I couldn’t possibly say,” Matthew said. “She may have just wanted to choose a younger solicitor, so that she wouldn’t need to go through the trouble of replacing an older one who would retire in ten or fifteen years.”

“She’s shrewd,” Reinhard said. But he suspected that Magdalena may have chosen Matthew for a certain innocent and good-looking charm that he had about him. That was the kind of thing that Magdalena tended to like. 

“I assume you don’t have much time to spend going over the details, Count Lohengramm, so when Baroness Westpfale said that you were intending to take me on, I took the liberty of gathering some of the relevant details about the estate you’ve inherited. I hope you don’t mind.”

“Not at all. Though I don’t have anything booked for the evening,” Reinhard said. “I expected that being thorough here would take a while.”

“Well,” Matthew said, sounding pleasantly surprised, “there’s still no reason to delay getting started.” He reached over to his computer and turned it on, pulling up some documents on the second monitor to show Reinhard, who looked at them with his usual exacting stare. “I thought a good place to start would be with the land. It’s on the planet Helmuth, and has been overseen by a crown-appointed steward since the Lohengramm line died out…”

Reinhard appreciated Matthew’s exactitude-- for all that he had said he hadn’t been a good officer in the fleet, Reinhard found that hard to believe: he suspected he would have made an excellent staff officer. It may have just been humility on his part, or a lie to excuse his leaving the fleet. Reinhard put those thoughts away as he listed to Matthew go over the details of the estate he had inherited. The land, the people who lived on it, the money, the various properties on Odin, and all the rights and responsibilities that being a count-- it was all new, and felt tedious. But he paid attention anyway, asking incisive questions that made Matthew raise his eyebrows each time. If Reinhard was going to do something, he was not going to do it halfway, or leave a task to someone else without understanding it. He had no desire to have some other noble scam him through misunderstanding the ways that noble society functioned.

Matthew’s secretary brought in coffee for the both of them while they were absorbed in the minutiae, but they finished their business before they finished the coffee. Since the sun had slipped past the window long ago, Reinhard had lost track of time, so didn’t mind sitting a little while longer to finish his drink before he made his way back home. Kircheis would be pleased that he was taking it seriously, anyway.

“You know, Admiral Lohengramm,” Matthew said, “quite aside from being happy to be your solicitor, I’m happy that you’ve given me the opportunity to get some first hand experience dealing with the inheritance of an estate this size.”

“Did you not have to for Baroness Westpfale?”

“It was somewhat less involved,” he said. “Her father had already sorted out most of the details, and a barony is smaller than a county.”

Reinhard nodded. “I’m happy to provide the experience, I suppose. If you find such things fascinating.”

Matthew laughed, and shuffled some of his papers into a neat stack. “Not particularly,” he said. “It’s my career, but not really my passion. But it’s funny-- if I dare say so, we’re in similar positions, Admiral Lohengramm.”

“In what way?”

“Just a few weeks ago, I received notice that a cousin of mine had died, and that I am now next in line to inherit the title of Count Grantham.”

“Congratulations,” Reinhard said. He didn’t particularly care, but it didn’t hurt to be polite. “Was that expected?”

“Not at all,” Matthew said. “I wasn’t aware that I was even in the line of succession. I was perfectly content to spend the rest of my life solidly middle class, and I had to go and get a letter that tells me my whole way of life is about to be upended.” He laughed. “But that’s the way things go.”

“I suppose it is,” Reinhard said. “Are you going to inherit soon?”

“No, I’m certain I won’t. The current count, Lord Grantham-- he’s my third cousin once removed-- he’s only in his sixties. I don’t expect I’ll inherit for at least twenty years. That’s why Baroness Westpfale encouraged me to take your case. She thought I would still have plenty of time to work on it before I became wrapped up in my own responsibilities.”

“I’m beginning to think that it’s more likely that Baroness Westpfale was trying to engineer us to find this commonality, and become friends.”

“I wouldn’t presume, Admiral Lohengramm.”

Reinhard smiled. “I wouldn’t worry about presumption, especially when it comes to the baroness and her schemes. She is a clever devil. I expect you, too, will have to spend your free time being shuffled between social events, now that you’re an heir?”

Matthew smiled. “I don’t know how well I’ll fit in at such things. I am terribly middle class.”

“So am I.” Reinhard finished his coffee. “If we end up trapped in any of the same parties, it will be good to have someone I know. I find some of these social events unbearably tedious.”

“I’m going to be spending quite a lot of time at Lord Grantham’s estate in the capital,” Matthew said. “Would it be presumptuous for me to ask Count Grantham to invite you, should we hold any sort of social event?”

“I’m sure Baroness Westpfale is banking on it,” Reinhard said. “If you’re looking for an ally to raise your image in the eyes of the old guard, I’m hardly the right choice for that.”

“The most successful admiral of the Reichsflotte wouldn’t be a good choice to bring to a party?”

“Herr Crawley, I think you’re about to find that there are few people more hated in the eyes of the court than myself and my sister. It may be that Baroness Westpfale wants me to associate with you to raise my status.”

Matthew laughed. “Is that you telling me not to bother to be social with you?”

“You can invite me,” Reinhard said, though he was sure the tiredness showed in his voice. “Though I somehow doubt it will help either of us, no matter what Baroness Westpfale thinks.”

“Excellent,” Matthew said. “I am sure Lord Grantham would be happy to have you-- and his daughters, I’m sure, would love to meet you.”

Reinhard forced a smile onto his face. “You’re very kind, Herr Crawley.”

Matthew glanced at his watch, then made a face. “My mother was expecting me for dinner over an hour ago. I probably should have telephoned her.”

Reinhard stood. “I’m very sorry to have held you up.”

“No, don’t worry-- I hope I didn’t keep you from anything.”

“My own dinner will be waiting, I’m sure,” Reinhard said. He extended his hand. “It was a pleasure, Herr Crawley. I look forward to seeing you again.”

“Likewise, Admiral.”

## Chapter End Notes

Chapter End Notes

i think the conversation with magdalena might be a tad long in the tooth, but i love magdalena, and i think that for the poor lost downton abbey readers, it's probably best to give more rather than less context, even if you are somewhat dropped in the middle of it. i hope that it's comprehensible to you what the situation is, even if you're not familiar with this cast haha. please let me know if you're confused! i'm very happy to add more context to these chapters if needed.

for the logh reader who has been following along: magdalena's gambit involves bringing up the events of "towards the tail-end of an age that's almost finished". this is because i love for my stupid little fanfictions to be continuous with one another. also because i think that one is particularly good. you should go read it if you haven't lol

look... in my brain logh and DA have some similar themes. they're both in some ways about dealing with living in the crumbling end of an empire. and they both have ensemble casts. and gay people who make absolutely godawful life choices. that's plenty. they're a perfect match.

yes i have appended 'von' to matthew's name. they're in stupid fake space germany. it's unfortunately required. and lord grantham is a count now instead of an earl b/c i don't think logh has earls, and they're [handwave] basically equivalent. matthew also only made it to lieutenant here b/c according to the logh wiki a ground captain is equivalent to a fleet lieutenant. feel free to complain about this.

thank you very much for reading! hey if you are a DA person-- you should read Wheel Inside a Wheel-- no logh canon knowledge is required to pick that one up! bit.ly/wheelinsideawheel . and everybody can go read the rest of my nonsense at gayspaceopera.carrd.co haha. you can find me on tumblr @ javert and on twitter @ natsinator , or join my discord if you like https://discord.gg/nvBWQ5vDxy
