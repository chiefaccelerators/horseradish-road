# Let the Good Times Roll On

Reinhard arrived at the Grantham estate with his key staff in tow. Since they were attending this hunt because they were fleet officers, Reinhard had decided it was plenty appropriate for them all to wear their uniforms, and Kircheis hadn’t protested. It saved him the trouble of dressing up, anyway.

Along with Kircheis, Reinhard had brought the two rear admirals under his command, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal, and his chief staff officer, Captain Mecklinger. Reuenthal was a tall man, slender, with dark hair and striking, mismatched eyes. He walked side by side with Mittermeyer, who was short and stocky with shaggy blond hair, cheerful where Reuenthal was somber. Mecklinger brought up the rear of the group, and was likely the least excited to be spending the day galloping through the woods. He had an average build, and his long hair and moustache would have been taken for aristocratic, except that his name lacked the necessary ‘von’. 

They were let into the house by a gangly footman, and they met Lord Grantham in the library, already dressed to hunt but waiting for everyone else to show up. 

“Count Lohengramm, I’m so pleased that you could make it,” he said when Reinhard entered the room. “Or should I address you as Admiral, since you’ve come in uniform?” He looked at Reinhard and his staff in uniform with a naked longing in his eyes, one that Reinhard tried to ignore.

“I’m grateful for the invitation,” Reinhard said, waving his hand at the question of the address. “I don’t have as many chances as I like to enjoy the natural beauty of Odin. I presume you haven’t had the opportunity to meet my staff?”

“No, I certainly have not. Spending much of my time off planet has rather cut me off from my old fleet contacts, I’m afraid. That’s something I’d like to mend.”

“Of course. This is Rear Admiral Oskar von Reuenthal and Rear Admiral Wolfgang Mittermeyer--”

“I believe I have heard your names,” Lord Grantham said, shaking hands with the two of them. “Duke Braunschweig had mentioned--”

“I’d like to think that whole affair is behind me,” Mittermeyer said, with a smile that tightened on his face as he spoke, though he still shook Lord Grantham’s hand warmly.

“Yes, of course,” Lord Grantham said. He seemed guileless, to Reinhard’s eyes, and smiled as he turned to Mecklinger and Kircheis.

“And Captain Ernst Mecklinger, and Captain Siegfried Kircheis,” Reinhard said.

“Pleasure,” Lord Grantham said, shaking their hands. “I’m so glad you could all come.”

“Most of us are on an extended posting to Odin, these few months, so coming is no trouble,” Reinhard said. “I expect to be going out sometime next month, but the rumor is it will just be my fleet, without the support of Reuenthal and Mittermeyer.”

Lord Grantham raised his eyebrows. “I’m surprised.”

Reinhard smiled. “I am grateful for the opportunity to prove that His Majesty’s trust in me is not unfounded,” he said. “I rely on my staff, but if there is talk that I cannot perform without them, I would like to dispel it.”

“Completely understandable,” Lord Grantham said. “I’m sure it will be a roaring success.”

The door opened behind them, and the three daughters of the family trooped into the room, accompanied by their mother. Reinhard nodded in greeting. All three of them smiled, but Reinhard only thought that the smile from the youngest, Sybil, was anything close to genuine. Edith’s was tinged with desperation, and Mary’s gaze roved across the assembly of Reinhard’s staff, settling on Reuenthal with a spark of interest. Reinhard ignored that. It was more trouble than it was worth to involve himself in Reuenthal’s personal matters.

“Let me introduce my wife and daughters,” Lord Grantham said, and made the requisite introductions.

When all the names had been said, Edith asked, looking directly at Mary, “Is the Duke of Crowsburg coming?”

“He is,” Lord Grantham said. “I believe he will be here soon, along with Matthew.”

“Excellent,” Mary said. “I’m so pleased.”

The girls were all dressed to go riding, but their mother was not. “You aren’t planning to hunt, Lady Grantham?” Kircheis asked.

“Oh, no,” she said. “I’m afraid I wasn’t brought up to enjoy it. You’ll have a more pleasant time without me there to slow you all down.”

“It’s true that today seems like a gathering of youth,” Lord Grantham said. “But I like to think that I can keep up with the best of them.”

“Are you a good shot?” Mittermeyer asked.

“I should hope,” Lord Grantham said. “I’m sure no one will mind if we go out and pick mounts and guns while we’re waiting for the rest of the guests to arrive.”

It was likely for the best that they all headed out into the bracing fall air for the walk to the stable, because it forestalled any awkwardness of remaining in the library with nothing to do. Reinhard, though he had barely said a thing, was already feeling like agreeing to this invitation had been a mistake. Of course, it had been Kircheis who had agreed for him, and Reinhard couldn’t object after that.

As they walked, Sybil sidled up beside him. “Might I ride with you today, Count Lohengramm?” she asked.

“As you like,” Reinhard said. “I wasn’t aware that I needed accompaniment.”

“We’ll likely split up, and it is best if you have someone who knows the estate.”

“I’ve been perfectly capable of navigating in much harsher environments than this, Lady Sybil,” Reinhard said, and a trace of amusement crept into his voice despite himself. “Remember when we were on Kapche-Lanka?” he asked Kircheis.

“I could hardly forget, Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said. “You are welcome to join us, Lady Sybil, of course.”

“I should ride with Cousin Matthew, then, I suppose,” Edith said, shooting an annoyed glance at Sybil as she did. 

“Deciding for him before he even gets here?” Mary said, her tone lofty. “Suppose he would prefer to ride with someone else?”

“And you think it would be you?” Edith said back. Delivering retorts was an instinct, Reinhard supposed, because she flushed immediately after the words left her mouth, realizing that it served her poorly to be rude in the presence of guests she was supposed to impress.

“Rear Admiral von Reuenthal,” Mary said, ignoring Edith, “would you care to ride with me?”

“Certainly,” Reuenthal said. Mecklinger, who was silently watching all of these interactions, shook his head to himself. No one but Reinhard noticed.

They made it to the stable, and were in the process of picking out mounts when Matthew von Crawley and the Duke of Crowsburg arrived together, led along by one of the footmen. Reinhard now recalled exactly why the duke’s escort at Magdalena’s party had seemed so similar: this was him. But he said nothing to anyone, though Kircheis caught his eye with a smile, and he simply went to stand over with the rest of the servants who would be trailing along with their ammunition and other equipment, staying well out of the way of the hunt itself.

Matthew had a somewhat strange expression on his face, one that only grew stranger when Edith asked if she might join him on the hunt. He agreed, with a glance over at Mary, who was adeptly conversing with both the duke and Reuenthal.

In the end, Mittermeyer and Mecklinger ended up with Lord Grantham; Mary formed a party with the Duke of Crowsburg and Reuenthal; and Matthew suggested that he and Edith follow after the party comprised of Sybil, Reinhard, and Kircheis. Reinhard didn’t care, but Edith was somewhat perturbed, and Reinhard expected she would try to peel him off at some point to go their own way.

A stiff wind was blowing by the time they set out, rattling through the dry-leafed trees. They headed into the wind, down the well-maintained but thin hunting trails that crisscrossed the estate. There was little talk at first, at least among their cohort. Reinhard slipped naturally into the intense, focused state that came whenever he had something to accomplish. The horse obeyed him without even a hint of recalcitrance, a tall white mare whose hooves kicked up leaves when Reinhard urged her to leap over fallen trees. Kircheis was silent beside him on a chestnut horse, looking around with keen eyes.

Sybil, on a lithe black horse, eventually grew tired of the oppressive quiet, and shimmied up next to Reinhard on the path. Kircheis pulled ahead to allow them some space, and Reinhard kept his eyes trained on his back the whole time.

“Do you like hunting, Count Lohengramm?” Sybil asked.

“Yes,” Reinhard said. “Do you?”

“I enjoy riding. Shooting, less, I’m afraid.” She stroked her mount’s neck as she spoke.

“You and Kircheis have something in common, then.”

“I’m happy to hear it.”

“May I ask you a question?” Reinhard asked.

“Of course,” Sybil said.

“Your father, he is social with Duke Braunschweig?”

“Oh, yes,” Sybil said. “I believe they went to school together. We usually have dinner at his estate at least once during the season, though he’s been busy this year, I’m told, so we haven’t gotten around to it yet.”

“I’m surprised your father continues to invite me around, then,” Reinhard said. “Duke Braunschweig and I have never seen eye to eye.”

“Papa doesn’t care about politics more than he cares about people,” Sybil said. “He likes you.”

“For who I am?” Reinhard asked, voice very dry.

Sybil looked off into the woods. “Well, for the idea he has of you.”

Reinhard nodded. “That’s a funny thing. It’s hard to know people for who they are.”

“I think I--”

“You think you know me, Lady Sybil?” Reinhard asked. He looked directly at her, in her eyes, and whatever strange and menacing light she saw there made her turn away.

“It was a silly thought,” she said.

Reinhard spared her, and changed the topic. “I suppose I care as little about politics as your father does, though I’m sure in a different way.”

“Maggie thinks you shouldn’t be so careless about it.”

“Baroness Westpfale cares about politics far too much.”

“I envy your ability to stay above it all,” Sybil said after a second. “I wish I could be the same.”

Reinhard was silent for a long moment. “It’s not that I do not care, Lady Sybil,” he said. “But when you have something in your life that is important to you, you realize how little the opinions of everyone else matter. If you find something like that for yourself, the ability to not care will most certainly come along with it.”

“I’m sure you’re right.”

“Of course I’m right.” Reinhard laughed, and Sybil did, too.

From a little ways behind them, Edith called out, “I think the path is a little crowded with the five of us! Matthew and I are going to take the next branch.”

Sybil turned her horse and trotted back to them. “You don’t have to go,” she said.

“It’s alright,” Matthew said. “I’ll see you back at the house.” He was serious enough that Sybil nodded, but let him and Edith go to trot back towards Reinhard.

“What do you want to talk to her about?” Edith asked.

“Nothing much,” Matthew said, and that was the last that Reinhard heard of their conversation before they vanished off into the trees.

Now truly alone with Reinhard and Kircheis, Sybil was much quieter, and she fell behind them as they moved through the forest.

“Are we hunting a deer, Lord Reinhard?” Kircheis asked after a while.

“It would please Lord Grantham, and Baroness Westpfale,” Reinhard said. This was as neutral of a statement as he could muster. He wanted to hunt, but he would rather have Kircheis be happy. “We can’t be said not to put in an effort.”

“I wouldn’t tell on you,” Sybil said.

Reinhard let out a dry laugh, but Kircheis just shook his head and pointed a little way off into the woods. There was a characteristic deer trail, with fresh prints sloshed out of a muddy depression in the ground. It was barely visible, but Kircheis had a keen eye.

“Should we dismount?” Reinhard asked.

“Lady Sybil, would you mind staying with the horses?” Kircheis asked.

“Of course. You go ahead,” she said. “I don’t want to slow you down.”

Kircheis, who had been somber this whole time, offered her a quick smile, and swung himself off his horse. He handed her the reins, then gathered up his rifle. Reinhard dismounted as well, landing on the forest floor with a quiet thump.

He nodded at Sybil, then walked with Kircheis along the deer’s path. Kircheis, despite how tall he was, made so little noise that Reinhard wouldn’t have noticed he was there, except for his occasional checking to reassure himself that Kircheis remained by his side. Kircheis focused on the trail ahead, lifting his hand to direct Reinhard silently.

Eventually, they spotted the deer. It hadn’t noticed them, as the wind was blowing in their favor, and Kircheis pointed out a place where the ground rose slightly, enough that they could lay behind it and not be seen. The red of Kircheis’s hair would blend in with the fallen leaves, at least.

They settled themselves down a ways apart, unable to see each other clearly, their rifles at the ready, laying in the slimy leaf-litter, and waited for the deer to move so that they could get a good shot.

It was a buck, one of its antlers half festooned with leaves. Weak sunlight dappled its flank through the branches overhead, and it took a few careless steps between the trees, its head moving this way and that.

They both knew when the deer would come close enough to shoot. Reinhard lined up his shot.

Just a moment more, and the deer sauntered past the bush that was blocking his field of view, into a clearing that gave him a good angle. Reinhard squeezed his rifle’s trigger, but at the last instant nudged the gun so that the shot went wide. He could have hit the deer, but Kircheis wouldn’t want him to, and why spoil the afternoon?

The sound of the gunshot rang through the forest, and the deer leapt in surprise.

But a second shot rang out to Reinhard’s left, and the deer stumbled and collapsed, thrashing, as the blood spilled from a wound low in its throat.

Reinhard stood, and Kircheis emerged from his hiding spot. “Good shot,” Reinhard said. There was a strange feeling in his chest looking at Kircheis, who went over to make sure that the deer was dead. His eyes were in shadow.

“Count Grantham will be pleased,” Kircheis said after a moment.

From behind them, they could hear hoofbeats approaching-- Lady Sybil following the gunshots. Reinhard and Kircheis said nothing until she appeared, and she looked down at the dead deer. “Congratulations, Count Lohengramm,” she said.

“Thank you,” Reinhard said. Kircheis would not want the credit, he knew, so he had no qualms about taking it. “We should get someone to bring this back to the house, and then go back ourselves.”

“We can take our time riding back,” Kircheis said.

“Of course,” Reinhard said. “There’s no rush.”

 

 

The sun was well on its way down by the time that Reinhard, Kircheis, and Sybil returned to the house. The sky had filled with thick clouds, and the wind continued to blow. Behind the house, in a firepit, some of the house staff were burning branches and leaves that they had gathered from the pristine lawn, a roaring blaze that sent a hazy cloud of sweet-smelling smoke driven near-sideways towards the trees. Rather than go inside, it seemed as though everyone who had returned from the hunt stabled their horses and returned their guns and then stood around the fire, drinking thermoses of coffee that the servants brought out.

Mecklinger and Mittermeyer were spattered completely in mud, but Mittermeyer was cheerful anyway. Reinhard greeted them and asked how their hunt had gone.

“Oh, good,” Mittermeyer said. “We ended up chasing one into a bit of a bog.” He gestured down at himself. “Lord Grantham went inside to change. How was your hunt?”

“Successful,” Reinhard said, and left it at that. “Reuenthal’s not back yet?”

Mittermeyer shrugged, though the tension in his shoulders was evident. “He enjoys riding. Probably won’t come back until after sunset.”

Reinhard accepted a hot drink when he was offered one, and stood staring into the fire, the edge of the trees in his line of sight so that he could see when the rest of the hunters arrived. Matthew and Edith had returned already, and Matthew wandered over to Sybil. He spoke in low tones, across the fire, but Reinhard still could make out what he said.

“I was wondering if Lady Mary and her entourage would end up riding back with you,” he said.

“No,” Sybil replied. “I haven’t seen her. She probably won’t be out for too much longer.” She shivered, and warmed her hands over the fire. “It’s gotten too cold to want to be out and not stand by the fire.”

Edith, who had been speaking with Mecklinger a little ways away from the fire, noticed that Matthew and Sybil were talking, and came closer, enough that she could listen to the conversation.

“That’s true,” Matthew said. He paused. “Sybil--”

“What is it?”

“I know it isn’t truly my business, but is Lady Mary serious about the Duke of Crowsburg?”

Edith couldn’t help but force herself into the conversation. “As serious as she ever is about anything, which is not very much.”

Matthew frowned and fell silent. It was for the best that he did, because it was at that moment that Mary, Reuenthal, and the Duke of Crowsburg emerged from the trees, leading their tired horses over to the stable. They all looked to be in good moods, and they were sure to walk over to the fire as soon as their horses had been stabled.

“You could try to let her live her life without worrying about it, Edith,” Sybil said.

“She shouldn’t treat it all like a game,” Edith said, watching the trio on horseback vanish into the stables. “Or, if she is going to treat it like one, she should remember that games are something she can lose.”

Sybil walked away, deciding that she would rather talk to Mittermeyer, and Matthew followed her.

“How late are we staying, Kircheis?” Reinhard asked, turning to him as he stared into the fire. It matched his hair, and Reinhard lazily reached up to tug on one of his curls. Kircheis smiled at that, though it didn’t reach his eyes.

“We didn’t agree to stay for dinner,” Kircheis said. “But you should at least say goodbye to Count Grantham when he comes back out.”

“If you say so.”

The duke, Mary, and Reuenthal left the stables. Reuenthal split off to go speak to Mittermeyer, but the duke and Mary came over to the fire.

“I’m told you caught a deer, Count Lohengramm,” the duke said. “Congratulations.”

Reinhard smiled. “Did you?”

“No, we didn’t manage to find any trail. I think we rather disappointed Herr Reuenthal,” Mary said. “Since he’s abandoned us so soon.” She looked over to where Reuenthal was side by side with Mittermeyer, who had relaxed significantly to have him back.

Reinhard did not say anything about Reuenthal. “It was a good day for a ride, anyway.”

“The weather on Odin is always colder than I remember it being,” the duke said. “I miss the tropics.”

“Are you planning to return to Phezzan soon?” Edith asked.

“Before the end of the season proper,” the duke replied. “But there’s plenty of life in the capital yet. So I’m told, anyway.”

“Are you planning to ride out the next few years there?” Edith asked.

“Such a heavy question!” Mary exclaimed. “It’s not exactly the best way to continue a conversation.”

“I only ask because Papa is planning to keep us trapped at home in the countryside,” Edith said. “I’m wondering how bleak next season is going to be.”

“Quite,” the duke said. “But it’s hardly only your fault, or mine.” He smiled. “And I don’t mind talking about it. If we are to make plans, we ought to know what we’re planning.”

“Oh, I’m glad you don’t mind talking about it,” Edith said. “Do you have assets on Phezzan, then?”

“No,” the duke said. “Or, at least, none worth speaking of. I own a small amount of property, but it’s just a place to stay. Most of my assets are tied up in my estate within the Empire.”

“Ah, so even if you’re on Phezzan, you’ll be left in the cold if things do go wrong here.” She looked over at Mary, and there was an evil, glint in her eye. “I suppose that’s something that Papa should consider before he gives his blessing for you to marry.”

“Why is that?” the duke said.

“Well, he would want to make sure Mary is with someone who would be able to support her on Phezzan, should the worst happen. She’ll have nothing but her husband, after all.”

The duke’s face twitched, or perhaps it was the firelight. “I thought that your mother had inherited a rather large fortune on Phezzan,” the duke said.

Mary’s mouth opened, and then shut again, and she squeezed her hands into fists.

“Oh, she did,” Edith said. “It’s all been absorbed into the Grantham estate, though. Cousin Matthew is to inherit it.”

“I see.” The duke smiled. “And what about you, Count Lohengramm?” he asked, looking across the fire and changing the subject. “I assume there’s no convincing you to run away to Phezzan with me.”

“I have no plans to run anywhere,” Reinhard said.

“You’re a braver man than I,” the duke said.

“Perhaps we should go back indoors,” Mary said. “It’s getting rather dark.”

“I appreciate the idea, but I can’t stay for very much longer. I’d just like to say goodbye to Count Grantham before we head off,” Reinhard said.

“What about you, Philip?” Mary asked.

“No, I think I’m of the same opinion as Count Lohengramm,” the duke said. “It’s been a long day, and I have a long ride home.”

“You’re not staying the night?”

“Oh, I had quite forgotten that you had extended that invitation to me.” His eyes roved across the lawn, now bathed in flickering firelight shadows, looking for something and not finding it. “Perhaps it’s best if I don’t.”

“My father will be so disappointed.”

“I apologize,” the duke said.

Something changed in Mary’s bearing; she had made up her mind. “Well, I should at least see if Cousin Matthew or any of your other staff would like to stay for dinner,” she said, nodding at Count Lohengramm. She smiled, a tight expression, and walked off with her head held high to where the other small group, comprised of Matthew, Sybil, Mittermeyer, Reuenthal, and Mecklinger, were standing and talking. They were too far away to hear, but they all shifted at Mary’s approach. Reinhard watched the exchange. It ended with Mary leading Reuenthal away from the group, back towards the house.

The duke watched, too, and said nothing.

Reinhard was just about to ask Edith if she thought her father was ever going to come back out, when from around the corner of the house, bright white high-beams from a string of cars rolled up into the driveway.

Edith stopped whatever she had been saying to the duke to turn to look, everyone’s silhouette cut bright in the foggy night air, the car headlights outshining by far the firelight, which had once felt blinding and warm, but now was dim by comparison. “What in the world?” she asked.

Reinhard and Kircheis shared one glance, and then immediately began heading towards the lights. Edith followed, though the duke remained standing by the fire, watching from a distance. Sybil and Matthew had already started walking to investigate, and Mittermeyer and Mecklinger joined up with Reinhard.

Getting out of the car, bathed in the harsh vehicle lights, were a swarm of military police. They were armed, but only the usual sidearms, and none of them reached for them even as the group of young people approached.

Matthew, deciding it was his responsibility in the absence of Lord Grantham, positioned himself at the front of the pack.

“Officers. May I ask what the trouble is?”

“On the business of His Majesty,” the officer in charge, a captain from his uniform, “we have come to search this estate in connection with a republican terrorist cell.”

Matthew was not rendered speechless, but his face paled. He must have known as well as anyone how the military police tended to get their way. “I’m afraid you must speak to Count Grantham,” he said. “This is his estate, and he will not allow--”

Resistance predictably caused the officer to grow firmer. “On the business of the Crown, we have the authority to enter any private dwelling. Please stand aside.”

Reinhard flashed a signal to Kircheis behind his back. Be ready to leave. He then stepped forward. “Captain, I would appreciate if you could explain why exactly this house, of all the houses on Odin, has been implicated in terrorism.”

Looking at his uniform, the captain restrained a flinch, then saluted sharply. “Sir, during raids on republican meeting places over the past week, evidence was uncovered that linked an unknown member of one cell to this house.”

“An unknown member?” Reinhard asked. “This is very little evidence to go on. If you don’t know who you’re looking for, I don’t know what you expect to find.”

“We hope we will find nothing, sir,” the captain said.

“You should speak to Count Grantham,” Reinhard said. Before the captain had the space to object, Reinhard turned to the pale-faced Sybil, who was biting her lip, and said, “Lady Sybil, please take Captain Kircheis inside to find your father and bring him out here. At the very least, no one should search his estate without his knowledge, if not his consent.”

Sybil looked like she could have wept with relief. “Of course!” She turned and sprinted across the yard, faster than Reinhard would have thought possible in her skirts. Kircheis followed, and they vanished into the dark stone house.

## Chapter End Notes

Chapter End Notes

noodle can have little a animal symbolism... as a treat. for context, please read Life Out of Balance, Chapter One

*let the good times roll on / through these first few desperate hours*

anyway the deer is a pretty in your face symbol of innocence or goodness / the loss of it basically wherever it gets deployed lol. this is the kircheis of  Untouchable and Golden and The Children of This World...  after all. very gift of the magi for reinhard to not shoot the deer b/c kircheis would want him to, and kircheis to go ahead and do it in order to satsify the social demands of the situation. this isn't related to the c-plot of reinhard moving out of their shared house at all...

i'm not totally satisfied with this chapter-- i think juggling too many characters means that there's a bit of dross that probably could be cut. someone sneak into my house with a pair of scissors and just start snipping please. but in the end it accomplishes what it needs to so [shrug emoji]. i hope it's entertaining anyway! this is definitely one that's more meant to make my other loghfic readers lose it :p

but we're really heading towards the end now! very exciting :^)
